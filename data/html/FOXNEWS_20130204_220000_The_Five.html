            story that was important to him. so perhaps, and this is no longer the sheriff talking but speculation, perhaps he was looking for hostages so he could get his story out. but of course if these initial reports that the suspect is dead, we may never hear the full story about this. >> jonathan, if these reports are accurate, this is a massively successful operation, hostage negotiation, do we know who was the lead hostage negotiations were? was it the fbi? was it the alabama sheriff's department, was it a special swat team? do we know how that worked out? >> yeah, that we don't know. we had a state, local and federal presence out here. we don't know which law enforcement department was involved or whether as you see at the command post behind me whether it was a coordinated effort where you had multiple people talking to the suspect through out this ordeal.           </div>
