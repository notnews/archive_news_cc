obamacare is a hazard for all hard-working americans. so now add trader joe's to agrowing list of company changing the worker healthcare due to obamacare and many others are cutting hours. this is not what we were promised. i remember hearing it would bring healthcare to more workers. now it's fewer. >> it's destroying healthcare and also potential employment of the country. 43% of the small businesses said they delayed hiring because of obamacare. 20% cut employees. another 20% cut employee hours because of obamacare. we have mentioned a few of the companies there. seaworld, lands end, trader joe. circle-k. subway franchises, all over the country cutting the workers' hour, cutting workers because of obamacare. it's force. it's force applied to healthcare and also to employment. that's what even after all of this intervention we still have unemployment above 7%. it will stay there as we become a european style socialist state under obamacare. >> eric: smitty, one thing if you mess with my chalupa. taco bell may cut hours.wendy's also. but if you play around with companies like delta, ibm, kroger food, you are talking major employers. >> what bigger message can be sent to washington than private enterprise saying we can't afford it, we're taking it away. that is a primary concern in country right now is jobs. what is happening now is the retailers are going to have a tough time finding cheap labor. how many people do you know go get a job like working at trader joe's as a cashier just for the health benefits? that is going by the wayside. the retailers are going to have to start forking over a lot more money just to get through people through the door to work. >> eric: julie, it's all about the job. all about people looking for healthcare. >> so now the trader joe's employees will no longer have healthcare through trader joe's, but have the same amount of money. some pay less and some paymore. this will allow trader joe's to make more money. this is good for trader joe's and not bad for the employees. i don't understand. you are talking about, jonathan is talking about the massive free market is bad for businesses. this is great for trader joe's. they've opened dub >> eric: hold on. hold on. let's do this. point out that trader joe's gave a statement. telling us that 77% of the employee won't see a change, for the remaining trader joe's crew members working an average between 17.3 hours and 29.9 hours per week based on the calculator provide through healthcare.gov. we estimate over 70% of them will pay less for comparable insurance. >> thank you. thank you. >> eric: trader je's says 77% won't see a change. >> what is interesting to me, afl-cio convention they have in los angeles just this last week, you had two major guys, ed hill of the electrical worker union.terry o'sullivan of labor international. these guys came out against it. this is not from the right wing. this is because it's destroying jobs and the union people understand this just as well as the people who are employers. so the employers and the employees and people with a selfish best interest, this is not serving anyone's best interest. >> eric: i have to i gree with wayne. the unions are saying this isn't a good deal. >> i love that you are talk about the this as we had trader's joe the employer talking about that is great for is workers, great for them and their bottom line. i don't understand. you won't believe trader joe's. who are you going to believe? if you're going to always pick your mantra, i don't understand. trader joe's is saying it's great for trader joe's. >> it's easy to believe that -- [ overtalk ] >> eric: guys, guys. john. please. >> workers who are having their hours cut, the employers are cutting jobs.it's not great for any of those involved, julie. it's not great for the economy at large. obamacare is force. force is opposite of the wealth creation. you won't see new jobs created or major innovation under obamacare. this is a hindrance to free market needed in this country. a long list we provide, not indicktive of whadicktive -- inf what will happen under obamacare. >> you have 2200 pages of regulations. nobody can understand it. people are trying to. they go out and they are spending the taxpayer money to hire people. to explain it. the people who are hiring don't understand it and congress who voted on it never even read it. >> eric: they sold us the healthcare plan and said the estimate $938 billion. it's up to $1.8 trillion. troubled what they promised. >> showing that less people will be covered when it was promised that more people would be covered with healthinsurance. bottom line, the argument that trader joe's -- what might be good for trader joe's, according to the statement. this isn't reality yet. it hasn't been proven. might not be good for the other retailers or the other restaurants or the other grocers of the world. this could have a long-term hazardous efect the economy in this country and the job market right now. bottom line, that should be the concern of the government right now. that should be the concern of washington. no providing healthcare. >> if you are a large employer, major employer and the only people forced in the mandate are the large businesses, the vast majority 95% are not under this. but if you are a large business, one of two things. you either provide healthcare and you will continue to provide healthcare so nothing will effect you one way or another. if you decide to get rid of healthcare for the part-time workers those workers -- by the way, any worker could do it today. they are not mandate to keep employing anybody or keep give healthcare to anybody. those people now have a place to go. they have healthcare.>> the open arms of government saying c'mon, come to us. this is what we wanted. >> no, i mean -- [ overtalk ] >> eric: jonathan? >> if only large employers are affect how come half of the small employers say they delayed hiring because of obamacare? >> eric: let him finish. >> well, it's affecting their hiring potential and the way they run the business. it's affecting the economy overall. you only like to look at what you see the net benefit. you don't look at the cost. the cost is burdened not by the individuals but by the employers trying to create jobs. >> eric: we got to leave it there. this could go on for hours. coming up, obama versus putin over syria. is this stakes, high-stakes battle in the middle east more about the economic superpower than the military might?

you have six-pack abs. we have the strongest military in world, bar none. we know. that should about we get back to focus on the economic strength? >> thank you. to the energy king himself, let's focus on getting natural gas out of the ground here to liquefy it and sending it over to china. what are we doing here? we need to find out a way to make china dependent on us and convert their dollars to our dollars. >> eric: john, globally, we rank fifth now in 2007, 2008.we were first on global competitiveness. not only, that economic freedom. tenth. sliding on just about every economic metric against the rest of the world. there is not a difference in water and new york and pyongyang or new york and havana, cuba. that created a superpower status. it was before the federal reserve or the minimum wage. or superpower status is established before that. to get back to the status, return to principles and the ideals. with this president we are going in the opposite direction. >> we are getting it back on the economic feet. >> i'm not sure that it has that much to do with how youregistered with the rest of world. the peace of the world was main taped 1815 waterloo to 1914 world war i. but by people who understood balance of power. we have a problem in middle east. if we could play one of those people off the other, negotiate between one and the other. if we could recognize what the selfish best interest are and utilize that, instead of using the military power with a threat, that is what we need to do to position ourselves with the rest of the world. >> we tax our people two have, we tax have a lot and give have-not quiet a bit. we are sliding economically. is this a bad policy? should we guess back to capitalist society. >> if you look the countries,one, two, three. as much as we were or britain, that is why we slid from 2018 the crash. there is a great point. i will agree. we need a robust diplomacy. we need to play these people off of each other and do what is in our national interest. >> eric: let me do this. we rank 25th against the world. in reading, we are 12th. education society, economic freedom. we are heading the wrong direction. >> we need the fantastic schools to do a wonderful josh enkating the kid. they are much less restrictions, or how long congress or business friendly climb. that is not a country's natural resources or themilitary to create wealth. it's a principle. i don't know if you want to move away and go toward the european style socialism? they have 28% unemployment in greece. >> how did you know? how did you guess? >> what is the alternative? >> what is the alternative? move away from capitalism. you're putting words in my mouth. all i'm saying is you are agree with wayne and what everybody else is saying yes, we need to double the effort to get the economy back on track. >> when you do obamacare, it's a socialized medicine, is it not? >> well, it is. there are things that are -- obviously, we need to rejuvenate the economy. we only need, we have had 4-1/2 years of obama. we are still above 7% unemployment rate. 3 the facts. we have to deal with facts. rejuvenate the economy in many ways. yes, capitalism is something,because capital schism brings us freedom. we know that. we have to insist on that. at the same time, you have to use your selfish best interest in diplomacy to get the best you can out of it. the proof of that is in history. just read it. >> eric: very good. we will, wayne. good advice. sound advice. coming up, forget protesting. inviting nine union workers to team up with the union bus some here say the new membership drive to drive johns away.

[ male announcer ] usaa auto insurance is often handed down from generation to generation. because it offers a superior level of protection and because usaa's commitment to serve military members, veterans, and their families is without equal. begin your legacy, get an auto insurance quote. usaa. we know what it means to serve.>> eric: coming up, big labor pulling out the rug from workers in america. voter of one state called>> eric: big labor making another big push for members. so far this summer we have seen protest for the nonunion workers and now the afl-cio announcing it will open its doors to any nonunion worker. jonathan, we have been seeing a summer of protest. this is bad for all workers. how so, sir? >> to the extent they join the unions it's bad. unions are pai parasite. they need fresh blood to keep them alive. the union membership is half of what it was on the 1950s. we know what they have done for the companies employed, the hostess or the textile workers long shoremen. they are looking for anyone to sign up. given union membership trends, i think they are likely to be unsuccessful for a good reason. >> eric: john pointed something out. in the last 45 years the union membership consistently with very few exceptions every year, they have lost membemembership. >> go to town. you're all for business decision, this is a business decision for the afl-cio. bring in more members to create more money for themselves. create more action for members. >> they are no longer representing the workers. they represent the political views. at the end of the day they are asking for a lot. giving back very little. i don't hold them as accountable if for government who has not sponsored the jobs in this country. they are not working. they don't have anywhere to go. the policy in the country is not help create jobs. not a business-friendly administration. >> wayne, i guess julie is right. you can't blame them for trying. they will take any workers. what does it mean? any worker nonunionized will pay dues to a union? for what? >> that is the idea. whether or not it's a viable idea is yet to be tested.i don't think anyone will pay a union leader to represent them politically, which is what they are asking. they are not doing anything for the worker. we don't have it anymore. the viability of a union is not what they used to be. there is nothing left for them to do. they are out to perpetuate themselves, they are leaders and trying to get as much money. just like a lobbyist. the lobbyist essentially. >> eric: right. it's a political lobby. unions -- that is their useful, you talk about the useful idiots, that's what they have become. >> unfortunately, not just lobbying, but being granted monopoly power by government. nobody wants to argue against anyone's right to advocate for the principle or position they want. where the unions have gone astray is getting the special favors, granted by the government. we know -- any number of thebusinesses, the industry airlines, automobiles for which the unions have been involved. i can't imagine why. i'm not surprised why most workers are saying no. >> eric: quick thought. >> wall street deserves a lobby, gun owners deserve a lobby but not unions? c'mon. >> whoa, get the lobby, not special favors. >> they represent everything and overall percentage of the workforce -- >> 11% for union membership. diminishing by the day. >> eric: thanks to san dr. dr. and sandra for joining us. lock, loaded, firing back. recalled voters spending a powerful message to the antigun politicians. don't tell us what we can or can't buy with our own money. 20 years with the company. thousands of presentations. and one rd earned partnership. it took a lot of work to get this far.so now i'm supposed to take a back seat when it comes to my investments? there's zero chance of that happening. avo: when you work with a schwab financial consultant, you'll get the guidance you need with the control you want. talk to us today.♪ ♪ >> eric: time for what do i need to know for next week? wayne, you are up first. >> kek out xbi. i'm a little leery of what themarket is doing. long-term, look for the biotech. >> eric: very good. little risky there. go ahead, john. >> africa. this is a hot destination. afk is the exchange traded fund i'm looking at now. this has financials. >> we have to leave it there. i love that song. that is it for cost of freedom block. thank you for joining us. before we go, they call two democratic lawmakers this week. president of the colorado senate, john morris getting booted from the legislature. they are expanding gun control laws. colorado is a blue state. something interested happened in colorado. something the democrats in 2014 might take note of. don't mess with the second a.m. we have a right to bear"

World With Neil Cavuto : FOXNEWS : February 12, 2013 4:00pm-5:00pm EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,"let the good times roll. they had a mini carnaval in rome right behind us in rome. it will all be different tomorrow. i'm shepard smith. here comes your world with neil cavuto. >> neil: thank you. tonight barack obama has choice, maggie or nicky or keep playing the same games on spending that have the capital more looking like walt disney. >> all it took a report out out of treasury of a surprising surplus to take the pressure off this president to cut spending this cold night in february. democrats quickly seizing on the data proof the deficits are getting better thanks to higher taxes. the president apparently says that his debt slashing is allbut done, he has come up with $4 trillion budget cuts and mission accomplished. it's over ten years and still leave us $35 trillion more bucks in debt over the same ten years. are we really saying it could have been worse? it could have been $9 trillion more, more or less. don't expect much cutting. because now is not the time to cut. you got to ask yourself, when is the time to cut? if the economy is too fragile to cut spending why is it perfectly fine to raise taxes? so revenue is good and less government bad? it's time to seized moment of spending right now but something tells me not this president and not now because it's clear that barack obama neither senses the urgency to cut spending nor the need and pelosi doesn't even see a spending problem. because now is not the time tobe cutting anything which i think says everything. he'll use the argue coming into office four years ago because we simply couldn't afford to do it then. six trillion in debt and four years later later. seriously, when is the right time to cut? when is the time to get serious. cuts are never easier. just as maggie thatcher, revolt of her own party when she to weather it and end up making history. >> no other party and reckless spending will stay with us. >> remember the boom that followed? the unprecedented boom that followed? for seizing such a moment, maggie thatcher became known as the iron lady. her likely punting big moment, barack obama has little to fearhe will ever be called the ironman. believe me, i hope i am wrong but art laffer i suspect i am not? >> it's the best monologue since johnny carson. >> neil: you are awful. >> are great. >> neil: finish your point. >> i love the spending cut idea. i don't think obama is going to do it but i remember thatcher did it. the reason we have a bad economy in large part is not in spite of it. >> neil: if it wasn't the ideal moment to cut in the midst of a recession four years ago and year later, it was dicey and year after that the recovery was still dicey, when is the right time to cut. maggie thatcher did it the midst of all environments, arguingthat longer term gains would more than justify acute short term pay? >> real serious thing, government spending is taxation, it really is. government doesn't create resources, it redistributes resources. when you should cut unnecessary spending is in the middle of a recession. i know people will tell you it's not true, but it is true. you can't tax an economy out of a recession. you just plain can't. >> neil: and i wanted to get with this into melissa francis into this, whether the first report out of the treasury indicates the whisperings of that. you can't hang your hat on tax hikes and can't be hoping and praying important another internet boom? >> you can't. you have to do a low rate tax and free trade and minimal regulations and get out of theway. the economy will get it out of the sefgs. that is what it is supposed to do. governments aren't the job creators. they set the rules and set the stage and let the private sector handle it. it's unfortunately not what this guy is doing. i hope somewhere along the line we have a boom despite all these bad policies and we probably will, maybe not a boom but we will come out of it. that is despite of the policies but because of them. >> neil: great to see you. >> and it was a magnificent introduction. i loved it. >> neil: let the tax hikes roll in. there is a big reason why the budget numbers are looking good or at least better. crediting higher payroll and income tax revenues for the shocking improvement. payroll taxes, bringing in 9 billion dollars in january andmore taxes and more spending cuts. melissa francis and sandra smith. what do you think? >> i have a totally different interpretation the mainstream media flipped this. you saw it on the screen, this is because the payroll tax cuts expired. they noticed all these writers that their paycheck on january 1st was smaller than it was before. this doesn't have anything to do with the government. that money that disappeared in january, hey, look, there it is. the government has it. i think they are waking up to what is going on. >> neil: i hope you are right, i disagree with you. sandra, one could seize on this and whatever we are doing is working because things are beginning to chug along and deficits are coming down. we're only looking at $800 billion deficit? >> that is not the case. the media is touting that $3 billion surplus, we're on ourway. it has nothing to do with the fact that there were spending less in the month of january. in fact it wasn't because they were growing jobs and economy was actually improving. they were taxing those that were earning more, bottom line, neil it doesn't address how that is going to impact things going forward in the next few months. >> neil: you are going to say it have a growth effect? >> we saw consumer sentiment fall to the lowest level in january as people saw their pay checks shrink. retail sales, it's expected to grow only one-tenth of 1 percent. they shrunk to create the $3 billion surplus but we're not going to be spending and feeling heck a lot worse about the economy. >> neil: what is going around. dow is getting closer to all time record. up 48 points today. they must see the same thing that you report on fox business. either they see it and ignore itor see it? >> they don't care what the government is doing. they are looking a what the fed is doing. that is what the stock market is all about. i don't buy it. i don't think they buy it. g.d.p. contracted in the fourth quarter. that was devastating news a short time ago. they are focused like a laser on ben bernanke and what he is doing. he has said he is targeting unemployment. they don't think it's going to go to 6%. he is going to continue to pump this easy money into the economy and keep interest rates low as long as unemployment doesn't drop too low. it pays to be in stock and bonds. that is what they are reacting to. what wall street is saying, unemployment isn't going down anytime soon. >> neil: what i worry about. we have the data on the left butthe excuse to not do anything. >> let's pace it the stock market has been cheering on bad news. more bad news on the economy, more stock market continues to go higher as melissa is saying, everybody is watching the fed. if things get worse they know they are going to step in and buy back more bonds and boost the stock market. >> neil: what if the president says nothing about spending resolve tonight. what if he continues, more initiatives and more ways to spend. is wall street used to that? >> there is still the threat of sequestration and we all get concerned and we see reality set in the stock market. everybody is starting to feel ancy how stocks and how high they are. >> neil: automatic spending cuts take place on march 1st, a lot of people think better than that tax hikes, we may go with that. >> actual real spending cuts in there, it's not when thepresident talks about $1.7 trillion he is going to save, it has to do with budget caps that may or may not happen, spending caps that no one believes is going to happen. its reduction in interest payments when they say -- interest payments will be smaller. >> neil: but mission all but accomplished on this? >> he leaves the uncertainty on the table. markets don't like uncertainty. if bare still left with that doubt going up to march 1st, we will see it reflected in the stock market. >> i think everybody is focused on the short term and they see what is right in front of them. easy money. they see companies are okay and they think unemployment is going to stay high and everybody is focused what is in front of them. nobody cares about the cbo reported showing what is going to happen to the economy if we continue to have the huge debt. they don't care.>> neil: ladies, thank you very much. in the meantime, i wanted you to alert coverage on fox business coverage, it starts at 8:00 p.m. we have powerful names there. you can see them but they are going to be going over what the impact of the president's speech and added

[ male announcer ] at his current pace,bob will retire when he's 153, which would be fine if bob were a vampire. but he's not. ♪ he's an architect with two kids and a mortgage. luckily, he found someone who gave him a fresh perspective on hisortfolio. and with some planning and effort, hopefully bob can retire at a more appropriate age. it's not rocket science. it's just common sense. from td ameritrade.>>. >> neil: all right, we are getting word of a fire-fight in los angeles involving that fugitive ex-cop christopher dorner. you might recall he is wanted for the murder of a police officer michael crane and attempted murder of three otherofficers. what is going on in los angeles right now he is trapped and exchanging fire with california police authorities. we don't know much more than that. there is, indeed, a national manhunt for this guy. he has brought are vendetta who have crossed him, but they seem to have found dorner but we don't know for sure whether they've got dorner or can confirm that it is dorner. we do know there aggressive exchange of gunfire in los angeles. we don't know much more than that. when we do have more, we will, of course, keep you posted. >> other developments, in the meantime, just take a look what is going on with the repeat of history. i am sure you remember the ripping this president took for this. how about this president for this. president obama making the casethat his debt mission is accomplished. take a look at this and virginia governor, he is not sure this is won by anybody. if he is saying that he is close to spending cuts over ten years, is that bad? >> we don't know. i think you and your former guests larry hit a good point. yours was an excellent point. what is wrong with someone going on to make that -- you just heard that. this is what i think about that. one of the beautiful things about the person that is going to give the rebuttal, there is no rebuttal to the rebuttal. he can say anything he wants to his interpretation of speech. the real deal is this. the president has been the master of the bully-pulpit.nobody argues that. he has been able to get things out and public has heard it. the republicans have not managed a mess edger to make a unified response. will it happe tonight? i don't know. >> neil: we do have to break away for developments in california. very quickly, i do want to get your thoughts on what is going on within the democratic party if the president is saying and nancy pelosi is saying, this whole debt cutting thing, we're done, that is not a focus anymore where moderates are saying not so fast? >> just saying accomplishes anything. you are absolutely right. if you look at the simpson-boles package that was supposed to be approached and yet people walk away from that. i'm very pleased we have found this person and i hope they gotthe right person zbhn as do we. governor, it's a pleasure. i apologize again. law enforcement officials say they believe that they have that fugitive dorner in their sights. a firefight. trace gallagher is in los angeles right now with the very latest. what can you tell us. >> trace: this is very fluid. we can tell you big bear on highway 38 one of roads, main roads that goes off from big bear which we have seen several times going down towards southern california toward riverside. there are reports now, a couple different reports either a home invasion with a suspect that the ""l.a. times"" is in fact christopher dorner tied a woman up or a couple up and then stole their white ford truck or their white dodge truck and fled. then there were reports that fish and game authorities actually spotted that truck and that gunfire was exchanged. it's very unclear at this pointin time if anybody was hit in that exchange. we're listening to scanner traffic. the scanner traffic is somewhat confusing so we don't want to go there just yet. we do know they were chasing a suspect on foot. there were reports they might have had somebody in custody and they are backing off those reports. in the past 15-20 minutes we have been hearing this ongoing traffic about now authorities kind of converging on this one area on big bear mountain. those don't know the back story, for the past five days, thoughts have been just flooding that mountain trying to find christopher dorner who shot a young couple then shot three police officers killing one of them. they believe now says the ""l.a. times"" that they do have christopher dorner either on the run or he is blocked out or in some cases they are reporting he is already in custody. we're trying to find out through various sources. there is no confirmation fromany police authority. we are in contact with lapd and san bernardino's sheriff's office but there is christian dorner is cornered or at least has been spotted in the past 10-15 minutes. >> neil: the couple you talked about, tied up at a cabin and one was able to break away and make the call, do you know that? >> this is a couple. christopher dormer who put out a manifesto and the young couple, the woman was the daughter of the lawyer who actually defended christopher dorner a at this police board hearing that ultimately led him getting fired. her fiance was the other person that was murdered in your vine which is 30 miles away where the police officers actually shot about three days later. then when this manifesto went public, police started con vergego because he named names. they started going out protecting all of these, quote, targets. that is when christopher dorner came one of those target, lapd pulled him over and opened fire on them. he then fled and 15 minutes later, that is when he shot and killed a riverside police officer, shot and wounded another police officer and then fled. now, we also know that subsequent to that he was seen in san diego trying to steal a boat. he couldn't steal it because the rope got caught around the propeller. he went to the boat saying he was going towards mexico and someone that found his wallet at the crossing between tijuana and san diego. then about nine hours later, when his truck was spotted in big bear, it was spotted at the home of one of the people who was named in his manifesto. that is the last time that christopher dorner or anythingabout him was spotted until about 15 minutes ago. now, we're hearing that in fact, they've got, is in fact a shooting going on. we have our fox affiliate in los angeles en route with their helicopter. they should be arriving at any moment. we're going to try to switch over so we can get it on television because our window is up and bear with us. >> neil: absolutely. >> hold on for a second. >> we're talking to christopher dorner or the person that is believed to be the fugitive exchanging gunfire with authorities. law enforcement was speaking on this on condition of anonymity but another one reported that looking like christopher dorner. that doesn't mean it's necessarily christopher dorner, but they have very likelihood that it is. of course, this has been anearly week long what began and now a state and national manhunt for this former ex-cop who has a lot of weapons at his disposal. a lot of expertise and a lot of anger. trace gallagher back on from los angeles. this was almost unprecedented manhunt for this guy. they were following any and all leads. apparently it paid off today. >> trace: the big event in california history. they flooded big bear mountain with hundreds of officers and the genesis was this manifesto where he was naming 40 different police officers in or connected to the los angeles police department. so they had all these police officers being protected and then you have this massive force up on big bear which is maybe 120 miles east-northeast oflos angeles. they flooded with s.w.a.t. teams and officers and investigators and despite the fact that christopher dorner's truck was found burned out with weapons inside and footprints leading away from there they couldn't find him. couple on tha on shortly after he disappeared it begin snowing up there. you had s.w.a.t. teams and the entire air brigade had to be grounded. then you had the officers o searching on foot what amounted to be blizzard where they got 12 inches of snow up there. so any tracks were clearly covered up there. were out cabins, summer cabins that were in the back country at big bear. they tried to check as many as possible. some of them had been abandoned and vacant for years, quite frankly, there are hundreds of these summer cabins up there. it would be difficult to check all of them and go back and double check again. this area we're talking abouttoday, there are two main roads that go in and out of big bear. this is highway 38. it's one of the main roads that goes out of big bear. the reports we're getting is that apparently that christopher dorner who apparently got tired of waiting says the ""l.a. times"" and either carjacked or home invaded a couple and tied them up and stole their white dodge pickup. that is when fish and game authorities came in contact with him at that point in time and shootout begin. keep in mind as this situation goes on, we are getting reports that this is an ongoing shooting. you have fish and game, i'm quoting here, san bernardino police department sending a 12 man tactical team to the scene. there were two assault weapons, two assault rifles that were inside that car. it is believed he had handguns as well as assault rifles. it may be that we're dealingwith a suspect who is armed with only handguns or he may have other weapons at his disposal. we know throughout this ordeal he was heavily armed. he said in his manifesto he knows the tactics of the l.a. police department and he will use those tactics to gain his freedom and to gain revenge against them saying he wanted to create an asymmetrical war and would come at them with a different angle. today he got tired of hiding out and decided to make a break for it. that is when authorities came in contact with him. we are getting one of reporters is saying that again there is ongoing fight here. the police scan ser calling for reserves to come in. they are calling for an all hands on deck situation, neil, in this this enclave of the mountains of southern cal. they believe that they havetheir man cornered or now involved in a firefight with christopher dorner who has been on the run for better part of nine days. >> neil: you mentioned asymmetrical war he claimed in his manifesto that involved 40-50 names. very angry. allegedly killed several folks. he didn't strike me as a person in the middle of this fire fight will go quietly into the night zbloolgt no, this is guy who said, i don't --. >> trace: no, this is a guy that said he would not see his name cleared. he feels he was wronged by the l.a. police department. he feels he was wrongly fired because he turned in a police officer for what he said was excessive force against someone that was being arrested. they had a hearing and they deemed he was lying. then he was fired.he said he would not live to see his name cleared, but that he said, i'm quoting again here, that he would in fact seek revenge against the sheriffs or police officials who took away his life and his good name. saying he never had a chance to have a family and now he was going to take their family and first two victims, say police, the soften and the daughter rather and fiance of the man who defended christopher dorner during that hearing that ultimately led to him being fired. >> neil: trace, separate issue, they check the border thinking he may have fled there. obviously did not seem to be the case here. with reports now that some officers down, do we know for example if he is by himself or any hostages or anything like that? >> the reports we have heard so far, he is in fact by himself.he stole this white dodge truck and he is by himself and heavily armed. the reports you are referring to about him fleeing to mexico that all transpired because there was a u.s. marble's report that he left his -- marshals report that he left his badge and wallet near the border. the boat he attempted to steal, he told the man a he could pick up in mexico. where his truck was found in big bear was a known associate of his. his parents own a home in big bear and the truck was found as the police were surveiling that home. it all ties together. they believe at some point, maybe he has an accomplice. when you fled with every resource and you still can't find this guy, plan ""b"", he hadsome type of associate or accomplice to get him off the mountain. now, we know if these reports are true, that somehow he was able to evade police for these past several days. in our he has decided that he was going to make a run for it at first. if they have him cornered now he is willing to fight it out. we believe he is armed to do so. as to reports where you say there are officers down, we had heard a couple scanner reports. we hated to go with this. it's very fluid. we heard couple scanner reports of police officers down, not one but two times. we are tempering this with the fact that none of this has been confirmed. that is why we're going plodding along. we're awaiting, they are still flying to the scene. it should take them 10-12minutes to actually get to the mountain so they can get a better idea what is going on. in a situation like this, you may have police waving off the helicopters so they don't give too much away. >> neil: i want to bring people up to speed. the biggest manhunt in california history, it seems to be coming to a fiery conclusion and potentially deadly one. christopher dorner is in in a gun battle with authorities. the outcome is unknown. we have a couple officers were down. we don't know the severity of their injuries. we do know that th shooting occurred after he burglarized a home in the area, tied up a couple stole their car. we're not immediately clear of the status of the couple or for that matter whether dorner was and is acting on his own, hadsome help, but he is in fire fight. others have identified this scene as an active crime scene. and trace revealed law enforcement officials are swarming the area given the fact that this guy knows authorities their secrets and going after bad guys. he is up on their strategy and he is apparently loaded. we don't know how much weaponry we has but detective, former washington homicide detective joins us right now. detective, what is the best strategy in dealing with this guy right now? >> i can tell you exactly what the police are doing. they are setting up a perimeter. that is always what we do any time we confront a suspect in the manner they have confronted this guy. even if he is shooting at police. police will not return fire atthis point. we're going to allow him to continue to fire if that is what he is doing until we get the experts. they do have the e.r. t.unit en route. these guys are specially trained. once they get into position, then they are going to return fire. as long as we know we got this guy cornered, as long as the police have him cornered. that is where they are going to keep him at bay right now. we don't know how much weaponry he has, but at this point it doesn't matter. the main focus for the police is to keep this guy cornered, make sure there is no other individuals in the area that can be harmed and then at some point the response is going to be dramatic from the police department. >> neil: this is obviously a wooded area. when you talk about whether there are people in the immediate area, they don't knowwhether he has anyone with him? >> that is one of the biggest challenges. i can tell you they are evacuating that entire, immediate area. we don't know if he has anybody hostage right now. we have to be careful. that is why the police will probably not return fire right now. the goal of the police is to keep themselves safe, keep this guy cordoned off and like i said when swat arrives and they will go in full steam ahead. >> is it your feeling given the prior violence and obviously the manhunt that has ensued for the better part of a week, this is guy who is not just going to quietly surrender? >> no, he is not going to quietly surrender. that is evident. i can tell you the police they know that. i have spoken to sources and they are all heavily armed because we anticipated this guy wanted to go out in a blaze.if you notice that is why the police have never left the big bear area. we thought in the back of our minds he was somewhere in that area and it likes look he is still there. >> neil: they didn't given up in the big bear area. and he may have crossed the border down into mexico, they never took that seriously either did they? >> no, they didn't. as a matter of fact they did look at that, they've been in conversation with the department of homeland security, but never moved a major artillery away from the big bear mountain. >> we are back to the geography of this area. it presents its own set of problems? >> it does because you have a couple roads going in and out. they have blocked off that highway so there is nobody coming in or going. we have gotten word we're talking about deputies that have reportedly been shot.there is now scanner traffic saying they want someone come in and get the wounded. we're now getting reports that there are possible wounded police officers and sheriff's deputies on the scene. remember, in the early going, we heard the shootout was between fish and game and christopher dorner. now, we have in fact police have confirmed to us that they do believe this activity does involve christopher dorner. again, we've got kttv, you can get a look and what they don't want is dorner to go back up in the mountains. the big fear he would try to lure them into some type of trap. they thought he had weapons. he said he wanted to kill numerous police officers. what they didn't want to do especially during the snowstorm was to try and send their authorities and officials into the jaws of evil and beambushed. two police officers that he shot in riverside, those police officers were ambushed. they were sitting, stopped at a red light and walked up to them and unloaded and shot both of them killing one. he is not adverse to ambushing police officers and he wanted to go out in a hail of gunfire. he is getting his wish right now. there are reports the fire fight is continuing. they are bringing more tactical units in from the los angeles county sheriff's department as well as the riverside county sheriff's department as well as local police on the scene that have been there for the better part of six days trying to find christopher dorner. they do believe this is the real deal. nobody is saying they don't believe this is dorner anymore, they think this is the guy. now it's a matter how it ends. does it end with dorner going in a hail of bullets. they believe he has struck a couple of sheriff's deputies. again we want to stress that isunconfirmed, but they are calling for ambulances. they are calling for back-up and christopher dorner is still armed, unclear if he is barricaded, unclear if she backing up this entire shootout. as we get more information and as kttv gets closer, we'll get a better idea what is happening. right now they are just at the edge of mountains. they are not quite to big bear. they are crawling over, they are five minutes we're told from the chopper pilot. crawling over the mountains as you go into the local san bernardino mountains and you get toward big bear lake and we'll have a much better picture of police activity and what is going on. right now, the report and scanner traffic telling us this shootout is under way. that it does involve the man they have been looking now for nine days, christopher dorner,who shot and killed a young couple, shot and wounded two police officers, shot and killed another police officer. this shootout is on. >> neil: we're also getting word that all schools, hospitals and public buildings in and around the area. from five to seven miles are in lockdown. this immediate area that dorner is supposedly holed up in is a collection of rental homes. again, the big bear area. and to trace's point they have already recovered a rifle, possibly a can of gas. the car that he had belonged to the people who he had held hostage earlier. he is without a vehicle of any sort and we don't know how much weaponry we he has with him and obviously enough to keep policeat bay? >> i understand the shooting has been going on. we don't know how many bullets he has actually fired and how many bullets authorities ever fired. how much weaponry does he have. we know he was carrying handguns. we know we left two assault rifles inside that burned out car. we also left camping gear inside the car. so the question was, if you are looking to survive in the mountains and looking for a shootout, why are would you leave two weapons in the car as well as your cold weather gear. that was unclear. we still don't have the answer. we may at some point in time. we do know he has apparently procured another weapon and he could be there for a while because we know he had another assault weapon we believe as well as handguns. so what he used to fire at these law enforcement authorities is unclear. the fact that he is firing at these law enforcement authorities is very clear. right now, we have a situation in big bear.to give people reference as kttv is going up over the mountain to find out where it is. police presence and correspondents on the ground is massive. it's getting bigger and bigger. they are not about, if they can help it, make his way back up in the mountains and saturday the search all over again especially when you have more police officers who potentially have been wounded in this shootout. they want this to end. they want it to end now. >> neil: stay there if you can. chris dorner is surrounded. it's going to be hard for him to get away. pretty much, it's going to be his call from here on out. he has taken a couple officers down. severity of those injuries has trace has reported, we're going to try to get the latest from william at lapd headquarters. what can you tell us. >> reporter: we know that fishand game has said that four to six of their wardens saw this white truck going down highway 38 from big bear, halfway between big bear lake and redlands, california. the wardens attempted to stop him in the white dodge truck. they had exchange of gunfire with california fish and game. no one was hurt in that initial volley of gunfire, however then, dorner bailed out of the vehicle. they got into a foot race. he headed into the woods. one of the local reporters was literally on the scene and over the air you could hear hundreds of shots being fired. the officers were telling him to get down in his car. a lot of profanity being used at the time. he was in the middle of it. you could hear a lot of gunfire between the officers anddetectives and sheriff's deputies and wardens and christopher dorner who had plenty of ammunition. two officers, deputies we're not sure exactly what agency they are affiliated with have been injured. we know at least one of them has been airlifted to a hospital. i might want to backtrack but we now know dorner basically broke into one of cabins and took the truck. what we're not sure exactly when that happened. whether or not it happened dating back to basically last thursday or friday or how long was he in the woods before he broke into this cabin. we know the search has been going on for a long time. we know a lot of officers said he didn't believe he was there any longer. they scaled the search 120 to 20 to 30 officers going through remote cabins. i'm assuming they knocked on a door and i'm told in this areathere are hundreds of cabins. maybe they hadn't come down this far on the mountain. i heard reports it was 10-15 miles from where his burned out truck was found. i'm talking about roughly this area around highway 38. it sounds like they do have christopher dorner on the run, in the woods somewhere around san bernardino national forest. >> neil: keep in mind, he is crazy or whatever you want to call him. he is apparently very crafty and avoided a pursuit in the past and gotten away a number of times before. we have heard that smoke degree naits niadz have been thrown in time to literally smoke him up. trace gallagher, do you know anything about that. >> trace: actually christopher dorner had smoke grenades, i can see our affiliate and going intothe cabins. the reason they are doing that, now we are getting reports that christopher dorner might have kind of withdrawn from this firefight and may be holed up in one of these cabins. really, if you look at this topography, he knows this area probably better than the police officers because he has been up there for the past five days kind of making his way around these mountains. they have surrounded now one cabin. we have gotten word of and now we are told they are setting up perimeters and bringing nor law enforcement officers in to figure out exactly when which one of these cabins he may be holed up this. for the time being and reports coming in from locals who are on the scene, for the time being, it appears the firefight has ended and back on the search for christopher dorner. we do know that two police officers as william was saying,unclear if they are sheriff's deputies or police officers have been injured in some capacity. we believe they were hit with bullets. we do not know the severity of their wounds. we do know they are being taken to hospitals or at least one has been airlifted to a hospital. that is really the clearest picture we've gotten so far. this is kind of really small sample of the barricade. you have s.w.a.t. teams and law enforcement officers on the other side which would give you an indication wherever the fire fight was, it's not too far off the road. snow is about 14-16 inches. they had a little bit before so this is happening within the deep snow. you have officers and this may be what they are kind of surrounded. one of cabins that line up along the road as you go down. at least according to scanner traffic, it's unclear as to which one he might be in. the shooting has stopped. the police officers have set upa perimeter. they are calling for more tactical units and calling for more police power on the scene. now, they are trying to figure out exactly which one of these out buildings or cabins he might be inside because he is heavily armed and if they can find out where she, they would waited him out as long as he doesn't decide to come out and started firing again. >> neil: thank you very much. you've got new developments from the lapd, what can you tell us? >> you know, the mayor antonio villaraigosa it's not just a question of if and when and the noose is tightening. we know from the manifesto he never intend to be taken alive. people thought he had a gunshot to the head and was dead. never, what i was going to say, it's a real problem for the taskforce. as long as dorner was alive he could not take down his guard. he could not remove that protective shield around the lapd officers and family that this guy had h threatened. nor could they pull their people out of big bear just in case he surfaced. think of the political fallout of that. then, of course, you had the wider issue of just did he didn't show up for days or weeks. as expensive as it was, to keep one 24-hour shift staffed, that is equivalent of five full time polgsz. he was dedicated can thousand officers to chase this guy and man the task force phones what has amounted to thousand tips coming into the task force since the reward was posted of million dollars. it's now at $1.2 million but nevertheless has trace ismonitoring the affiliates, it sounds like like they have him surrounded and getting ready to make sure they have all the manpower and firepower to go in on him so no one else is injured. >> neil: that statewide national manhunt made his picture so recognizable photo in america. almost anywhere he woulding in that area, he would be instantly recognizable? >> that was definitely the kind of double-edged sword here because he was so well known, he couldn't show up at a gas station without being recognized. as you have seen from surveillance video, it's everywhere now whether you check into a motel or get gasoline, someone has your photo and just a question of finding you. also today, just to reiterate, police were on track. they said to residents in big bear just this morning, pleasing over your surveillance video,your home surveillance video to see if you see this guy, maybe in a vehicle any time between last thursday and today. so as of earlier today, they didn't have any idea where he was and he turns upright under their nose right in the area they have been searching all along. >> neil: thank you very much. it's hard to believe this whole saga with six foot, 270 pound former policeman begin six days ago after authorities say, chris dorner took out captain's daughter and her fiance and released a manifesto that he first posted on fb. here is where it got interest ago for state officials, very intimidating and worrying that he was declaring a warfare on all of those individuals which left the state police to do something unprecedented. assign officers to guard the more 50 families connect"

more government spending. he vowed his plans would be fully paid for. >> nothing i am proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. it is not a bigger government we need but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad based growth. >> peter doocy is live in washington with more on last night's address. good morning, peter. >> president obama told the nation last night that reducing the deficit should be part of the federal government's agenda. the north star that guides her effort must be a growing economy that creates good middle class joabs. he also says nobody works full-time should have to live in poverty and proposed raising the minimum wage about 25 percent from 7.25 to $9 an hour. >> since the last time this congress raised the minimum wage19 states have chosen to bump theirs even hire. tonight let's declare in the healthiest nation on earth no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. we should be able to get that done. >> the president mentioned mitt romney twice in his address once he and the former republican nominee for president agreed raising the minimum wage for the cost of living was a good idea. bipartisan compromise has been hard to come by since november 11th. if both sides don't try try to they want he will do it with a pen a series of executive orders. if congress won't act soon to protect future generations iwill. i will direct my cabinets to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.   the president will lead to try to help the middle class there. they will do the same thing in georgia and illinois. peter doocy live in washington, thank you. that brings us to our look who is talking. we are hearing from florida senator marco rubio. last night following the president's state of the union it was rubio chosen to give the public response and play out the differences between the two parties. >> my parents immigrated here in pursuit of the opportunity to improve their life and a chance for their children to have a better one. they made it to the middle class. my dad working agz a bartendermy mother as a cashier and a made. i didn't inherit any money from them. i inherited something far better the real opportunity to accomplish my dream. raising taxes won't make a better job. that's why i hope the president will abandon his obsession with raising taxes and instead work with us to achieve real growth in our economy. this idea that our problems were caused by a government that was too small is just not true. in fact a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created reckless government policies and the idea that more taxes and more government spending is a way to help middle class taxpayers that's an old idea failed every

gretawire for you. go read it, answer it. we'll see you tomorrow night, good night. . >> bill: the o'reilly factor is on. tonight: >> [shouting] >> bill: two christian activists attacked at a gay rally in seattle. the situation gets out of hand. why does this kind of thing continue to happen? we'll have a special report. >> very difficult bill to pass because there is a lot of moving parts. and for legislative process can be ugly. >> strike over immigration reform also very apparent within the republican party. how will the g.o.p. solve this huge problem? we will tell you. >> the law as written probably can't work. >> i think the whole thing may collapse. >> bill: brit hume says obama care may be dead on arrival. mr. hume will be here.caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. the factor begins right now. ♪ ♪ >> bill: hi, i'm bill o'reilly. thanks for watching us tonight. the era of bad feelings. that is the subject of this evening's talking points memo. all over the country, americans are attacking other americans over political issues. on sunday, june 30th in seattle, two christian activists showed up at a gay pride rally holding signs saying repent or else and jesus saves from sin. the two men were attacked. >> that's a big [bleep] if i were you i would [bleep] [shouting] >>[screaming] seattle police have arrested two men, the fat guy who was slugging him and i think that's the guy, well, i shouldn't say, this one of the men arrested has nine felonies, nine on his rap sheet. now, obviously this is very disturbing, yes, the christians were looking to be provocative, but, that's no excuse for violence. if gays really want to be proud, they will overlook criticism like that. on another political issue, tensions are also rising. immigration reform has divided mucks. in favor, marco rubio, john mccain orrin hatch, general and george w. bush against rand paul, mitch mcconnell, ted cruz, limbaugh and sarah palin. >> i think it's important to fix a broken system. treat people with respect.have confidence in our capacity to assimilate people. it's a very difficult bill to pass because there is a lot of moving parts. and, the legislative process is -- can be ugly. and but it looks like they are making some progress. >> now, talking points believes that immigration reform will pass this year. i also think the senate bill can be made much better by the house of representatives. loopholes need to be closed and border security should be paramount in the new law. but if you're gonna oppose any kind of work legalization for millions of illegal aliens. you're going to lose. majority of americans understand that the immigration chaos is partially the government's fault. we could have secured the southern border a long time ago, but the feds wouldn't do it. and we certainly can pro-prosecute people who oversay their visas. again, the justice department doesn't care. the bitterness over immigration does the republican party no good at all. fair minded americans do not want unfair policies.so, immigration must be dealt with in a disciplined, but humane manner. now, as far as the far left loons you saw running wild in seattle. there is little hope for them. beating people up because you disagree with them is a crime. the far left in america continues to damage this country. and that's the memo. now, for the top story tonight, more chaos on the obama care front as you may know. the president has put often forcing obama care mandates for american business until 2015. and late friday deep into the fourth of july holiday, the obama administration announces it will not verify the incomes of individuals asking for obama care subsidies. that, of course, is madness and would lead to massive fraud. today, the feds backed out a little bit and they said well, maybe some kind of verification might happen, but you can see how screwed up this whole thing is. joining us now from washington a man who sees big trouble ahead for obamacare, fox news senior political analyst brit hume. what's the biggest problem so far with this? >> you just touched on it, it's the seeming inability of the administration to get this thing imflemented. let's not forget that lost month the government accountability office looked at the exchanges, which is one of the principle vehicles through which insurance will be dispensed under obama care and they're supposed to be, you know, one in every state either set up by the state or the federal government. the gao says -- looked to it as if they might not be ready on time. they are supposed to be ready in october for people to start signing up. if they are not ready and the employer mandate isn't in effect, that leaves obama care in a well-behind-schedule for its implementation for as much as a year or more. it looks as if this thing is so unwieldy they can't get it going. biggest thing they face right now. long standing popularity. >> bill: i have always believed that this is -- the obama care legislation is an income redistributionploy. that's why it was supported by the left and president obama embraced it so much that 20 million americans or 30 million -- i forget what the number is -- who don't have insurance, many of those people just don't have any money. so you are basically giving them free insurance that brit hume, bill o'reilly and everybody else is paying through their tax receipts. giving them free insurance. but now comes word i love. this they sneak it out like we're not going to get it on monday? do they think we are not going to see this we can't really verify obama care. so that anybody who applies for this subsidy, the free insurance can pretty much get it even if they are making $800,000 a year. and i'm going to myself: this is insane. am i wrong? >> well, no. you are not wrong. and, you know, i think they were always going to have to rely to some extent on the say so of the applicants.remember, too, bill, one of the problems they are having is now that they have postponed the employer mandate, the easiest way for them to know which employers are providing insurance and which are not is gone, at least for a full year after this program is supposed to start. that means that when people apply for and obama care subsidy, onef the requirements is that you not be getting insurance already through your employer. well, the easiest way to verify that is now gone. so, in addition to the problems they may have verifying income eligibility, they also have problems verifying the question of whether the employer is providing insurance or not, so that's another problem. >> bill: if you strip it away, anybody who applies for subsidies, nobody is getting obama care under their employers until 2015. that comes off the table. >> no. no the employers are not required. a lot of people -- look, you and i have it through the company we work for. we will continue to have it. >> bill: we have insurance coverage. >> brit: that's what theemployers are required to furnish to at least businesses with 50 or more employees. >> bill: that will be it. but the ones that are not involved, okay, they are off the table now for years. so you can walk in and basically say, hey, i don't really have any insurance. can you give it to me because i don't have any money. and if nobody is going to verify your income, you could have, as i said, a lot of money and who is going to know? the irs might get involved. i guess they are going to stop auditing the conservatives and take a look at this. recommendation eventually they would be able to find out through the tax returns and the tax system and they would have to go back after this. look, let's not forget another problem here. this employer mandate applies to companies with 50 or more employees. that means that a lot of companies are going to make sure that they don't have 50 full time employees. >> bill: that's hurting the employment. >> it's going it hurt hiring, bound to. because that's a perverse incentive for hiring. and similarly going it hurt people looking forfull-time work and finding because of obama care they can only get part-time work. this will tend to be a drag on hiring which is the last thing a nation with 7.5% or more people -- >> bill: that's why he they're put it off to 2015. hire people and that's why they did it? >> i suppose. i think also the thing with -- i think legitimately they couldn't get it going. it raises the question whether they will ever be able to. this law is extremely unwieldy and complex, bill. they are having a terrible time with it. >> bill: that's for sure. brit hume, everybody. next on the run down the judge in the zimmerman murder trial says the jury can hear

finally the judge has ruled that the jury can hear about traces of marijuana being in trayvon martin's system at the time of his death. joining us now from washington, fox news contributors mary katharine ham and juan williams. so, juan, is the case all about race and, if so, are you seeing bad things if zimmerman is acquitted? >> yeah, of course it's all about race. it's been all about race from the start. remember when the media, i think, unfirly libeled zimmerman making him out to be some, you know, kkk guy who has profiled trachmartin right from the start. described him to police played with the tape to make that happen. and i think right now it's sad to me because i think the media now is playing for the most primitive racial division. conservative posted to back zimmerman. liberals are supposed to back trayvon martin. i think it's become like for them you know o.j. simpson rodney king redo. and the second part of your question already you see that in sanford, florida religious leaders, civic leaders are now having to go out and hold meetings with the community trying it say don't have a riot if somehow, you know, zimmerman is acquitted of this crime. >> bill: what do you think mary katharine? do you think bad things are going to happen if zimmerman is acquitted. >> i pray that they don't. i am glad there is civic leaders involved and on this issue. i do think that when you have the entire media really jump to make this a racial more rattle play from the very beginning. >> bill: how is the media doing that?juan cited a couple of bogus things that came out of nbc news doctored tapes that made zimmerman look like a racist in the very beginning of the case. >> right. >> bill: we exposed this here. how does the media continue to make this all about race and not justice? >> i think from the very beginning, when they referred to it as a very simple frankly white and black issue, when that was not the case for zimmerman certainly, he was raised in a multiracial household. so a lot more complicated than what they first presented. i think once they went in hard on that narrative, they sort of had to back it up as we went along and media reports referring to zimmerman as a white hispanic, whatever that means. so, the problem is when you make something into a national conversation about race in this country, it's pretty likely you are actually not going to be having much of a conversation because it becomes on its face racist to examine the facts and bring up the fact of zimmerman's upbringing or what have you. then you get to the situation where we have a reasonable doubt system.and it is not necessarily going to come down in exactly the way that the media decided and everyone decided it should from the very beginning. >> bill: what happens, mary katharine if the man is acquitted. the reportage last week across the board, not only on the fox news channel but on the other news agencies as well said the prosecution presented a weak case. i didn't hear anybody say the prosecution presented a strock case, i didn't hear anybody. and today you get the 911 thing just devastated, just thrown out because the mother, trayvon martin's mother was an effective witness last week and now today it's all gone because the number of people said oh, no, no, no, it was zimmerman's voice and the father and all of this. so, if the prosecution did present a weak case and that again, is the consensus of the media following it, even the liberal media. >> yes. >> and he does get acquitted mary katharine, are you expecting people to run out and cause trouble? >> i think some people will react emotionally. i think it's been emotionally charged from the beginning and part of that is the way it wasportrayed by the media from the very beginning. part of it is also a general wish grievance. >> bill: possibility for damage to be done to the fabric of the nation. if this verdict comes in as an acquittal. if it comes in as guilty, i don't think there is going to be any violence. think think there will be people that will be angry. >> let me say the damage done to the fabric of the country by the way the media has portrayed it and the way it's been handled. you know, look, if my kid walks up to your house, bill o'reilly and some guy says oh, i saw a black kid walking up to bill o'reilly's house so i shot him, you would be like what is going on here? if a black guy shot a white kid, and they said oh, the kid was carrying skittles and ice tea you know what these punks get away with it all the time. forget who was on top of who and who was punching who. why was a guy with a gun deciding he had to it act violently with a teen with an ice tea. >> bill: you have to buyinto the six women sitting there are going to do the right thing based upon the evidence and their convictions of what -- >> -- you have to pray. it's an all white -- i think it's five whites and one hispanic on that jury. it's kind of odd to me. but so be it. you have to hope. it just seems to me there is something crazy here when this black kid unarmed not hurting anybody gets shot and killed. >> bill: you are almost fueling the potential violence here by saying that. >> i'm not. >> bill: you are. let the facts be presented and the jurors decide, go ahead, mary katharine. >> i was going to say i do think part of the emotion comes from the fact that there are genuine grievances with the black community with the justice system. black men are arrested for main use far higher rates than white people even though the usage rates are the same. there is some of that comes from that i don't think this is the way to actually address those by turning this into a situation that becomes tainted by race at every turn. both of you feel that there is a strong violence ifacquittal comes down. we have to now the media try to tamp that down starlight now. next on the run down, actor lamar burton says race is a major factor in the u.s.a. and in the lives of for instance and not in a good way. later, bernie goldberg and adam carolla will both opine on the factor. opine on the factor. we're coming right back. oh, he's a fighter alright. since aflac is helping with his expenses while he can't work, he can focus on his recovery.he doesn't have to worry so much about his mortgage, groceries, or even gas bills. kick! kick... feel it! feel it! feel it! nice work! ♪ you got it! you got it! yes! aflac's gonna help take care of his expenses. and us...we're gonna get him back in fighting shape. ♪ [ le announcer ] see what's happening behind the scenes at aflac.com.>> bill: personal story segment tonight, as for instance see the trayvon martin george zimmerman situation and life in general. joining us from los angeles actor lamar burton. are you following the trial closely mr. burton. >> i'm following it not closely. i don't watch the trial daily. i get a daily update through my twitter feed andother news sources. >> any preconceived opinions on it? >> on the outcome of the trial? >> yeah. on the situation? i mean, you just heard. >> the process. >> you just heard juan say that it disturbs him that the whole thing was in motion thatten a unarmed black man who just out for a soda and candy winds up dead. >> um-huh. >> those are the kind of perceptions that can cause angst if a verdict comes in that is an acquittal. you know that. >> that's part of the tragedy of this case that a young man unfessly lost his life. no matter, you know, what the verdict says, there is a young kid who is dead. and did it really need to come to that. >> bill: it didn't. it didn't need to come to. but now we have to see that the person who shot -- >> -- we have to see if the system works. >> bill: it's more profound than thanks we he have to see if the system works. >> bill: it's more profound than that. is the man guilty of murder because that's what he is charged with. >> yeah.>> bill: if is he acquitted, you as an friend and an intelligent guy, if zimmerman verdict comes out not guilty by the jury, do you know what your reaction is going to be? >> i don't. no. i didn't know what my reaction to the oj zherdev verdict was going to be. there have -- there have been many, many when i have been surprised. >> bill: what is borrow yoction when he was acquitted? >> i was really surprised. i did not see that coming. >> bill: did you think justice was done in the case? >> i have no idea of knowing. >> so you were neutral on that and you were just surprised that he got -- >> -- it was a very -- it was a very -- it was a very shocking moment. i mean, i think no matter what your expectations were, the idea that you had seen the progression from the slow speed chase through all of the courtroom drama and to havebeen up against those odds to say not guilty was a big surprise. >> bill: yeah, and the evidence was overwhelming against simpson and the civil trial pointed that out. so, it was interesting. so, you, right now, don't know if zimmerman is found not guilty and that doesn't mean he is innocent. not guilty means that the state has not met its burden in proving that there was murder. again, this is the sophisticated thing that i think is being lost on a lot of people. all right. you made some provocative comments on a news network about driving while being black. driving while being black. and you said -- >> -- why was what i said provocative? >> white people understand. i don't understand. i was pulled over by a black cop a few weeks ago. he obviously didn't like me and gave me a nice big ticket even though i had a pretty good excuse for what i was doing. that was all right. i was wrong. i took the ticket.i didn't feel threatened in any way. i picked up the vibe that he is not a big factor fan. but you, on the other hand, when you are pulled over, you feel -- >> -- the difference between you and me, bill, is that and i may well get to a very pleasant exchange with an officer once he approaches the car. the difference between when you get stopped and when i get stopped is i want to make sure that that time between when the officer leaves his car and approaches mine that he is as relaxed as possible. >> bill: that the officer is as relaxed as possible? >> that the is officer is as relaxed as possible. >> bill: why do you want to make sure he was relaxed? because that didn't pop into my brand. what popped into my brain i will explain why i did this and he will understand. it wasn't that i want him to be relaxed. why do you want him to be relaxed? >> because, because i live in a country and in a culture where it can sometimes be dangerous to be a young black male. the sta statistics areoverwhelming some aspects of crime. overrepresentation of our prison population of young men of color. it's just -- it is historically dangerous to be a young black man in america. and it's no different for me than it is for, you know, for anyone. my age and race. >> bill: i understand that does the fact that reported crime, not convicted crime, reported crime so overwhelmingly tilts toward friend men mitigate this that reported crime. mostly by other for instance, all for for african-americans. dot that mitigate anything. >> i don't believe it does. you have to look at the it culture which this bias is held. you have to look at the imagery of the culture andwhat the popular culture has turned out in terms of the representations of people of color. look, whenever you have majority population, and, you know, the united states of america is in the middle of a huge shift in terms of the makeup of its population, racially whch you have a majority population. the majority is always going to set the rules. and it -- and our case black people have traditionally pa bit actually, institutionally been disenfranchised and targets of law enforcement more than any other group. >> bill: i have to run. i want to talk to you about this again. i want you to do research for me. i think it's a fact that proportionally young black men commit far more crimes than any other group in this country. i think that's what is driving all of this fear on both sides. mr. burton, very good conversation. >> um. >> bill: we will pick it up. >> we will talk again,bill. we will talk again. >> bill: plenty more as the factor moves along this evening. jim carrey apologizes to gun owners for the comments. adam carolla has thoughts. putting leisure activities putting leisure activities ahead of serious issues.

do you do that? >> well, the federal aviation administration is responsible. the ntsb investigates accidents where a separate organization. but the faa does have in country experts and some countries and they may send people to travel to other countries. but they do have to work with their counterparts to make sure standards are upheld. >> bill: sure i'm wondering what the oversight is in the faa and your agency to make sure these guys know what they are doing. let me give you an example, i flew in the 1990s on air vietnam most harrowingexperience, ducks walking up and down the plane. it was crazy. i would never get on another vietnam plane back then. i'm sure they have upgraded now it was a dangerous experience. the salvadorian airline during the salvadorian war was crazy some didn't even have radar. when i see a plane crash like this and the guy didn't have much experience on the 7777 even though there were four pilots, weighs in command, that makes me nervous. >> well, i think in all of these accidents we have to look at all of the facts before we reach conclusions. it's just been a couple of days. we do know a lot about the flight from the cockpit voice recorder. the flight data recorder. it is important for us to look at pilot qualifications that's going to be a part of our investigation. we conduct very thorough investigations and our team is actually in the process of interviewing those pilots today. >> bill: you don't have any sway over what south korea does. that's my point here. now, on the front of these planes coming into theu.s.a., do the pilots have to all speak english, right? they all have to speak english, correct? >> sure. and just to go back, the faa does have some sway. they have to get operating authority to come into the united states. they have to meet certain standards to do that. >> bill: but nobody knows if they do or not. that's my point. but the english, let's stay on that. all the pilots have to speak english, right? >> english is the universal language when it comes to aviation. all pilots around the world and air traffic controllers do communicate in english in order to have that commercial operations. >> bill: because i know on the voice recordered there is korean on that recorder as well as english. is there not? >> that's right. when the crew is talking to each other, they may be talking in their native language. when they are talking to air traffic control, those communications are required to be in english. >> bill: all right. terrible thing. and you know, there is nothing we can do. flight safety record in the united states is beingexcellent so we want everybody to know that don't panic. i just wanted to find out the oversight of the rest of the world. appreciate you coming on tonight. we know you had a busy day. bernie goldberg said president obama and secretary of state kerry was goofing around when ♪when you experience something great, you want to share it. with everyone. that's why more customers recommend verizon, america's largest 4g lte network.>> bill: thanks for staying with us, i'm bill o'reilly. in the weekdays with bernie segment tonight. criticism by some in the media that secretary of state and president obama were involved with trivial pursuits instead of play paying attention to the blow up in egypt. >> i don't know how this happened it was terrible optics. the next day the president goes golfing and secretary kerry is out on his yacht. what does that say to young people in egypt across the middle east part of the debate about america's interest in the region? >> bill: is that criticism justified? joining us now from north carolina the purveyor of bernard goldberg.com about mr. goldberg. we have eaten this before not only in president obama with bush the younger, dwight eisenhower golfing, while the sof soviets are moving across poland whatever. justified? >> i think the analysis that you just played is absolutely correct. the optics are terrible. the president of the united states of america isplaying golf in short pants and a polo shirt while one of the most important countries in the arab world is unraveling, yeah, that's a bad picture. but, i don't think those optics were a mistake as bad as they were. i don't think it was mistake. president obama was sending a message to president morsi and the message was, i never liked you, i don't like you now. in many ways you are worse than mubarak, the dictator that you succeeded and playing golf says: i am not going to lift a finger. i'm not going to say a word publicly that will save you from being thrown out. so i think that's one strong possibility. the second one has absolutely nothing to do with diplomacy or politics. and it's pretty simple, bill. i think it may actually be the real reason. president obama just lane likes playing golf. i don't think it's possible that he is going to say i'm not going to let some crisis in cairo interruptmy golf dame game especially on a long holiday weekend. >> bill: kerry likes his yacht out in nantucket. they like their leisure time. they work hard. they are entitled to it however, however, when you get a president who whose management style is under fire and it is, certainly, i was talking to mort zuckerman the publisher of the new york daily news not a conservative newspaper about the president's management style. and the message he sends not just to the egyptians but to kind of the world is, you know what? ah, it doesn't really matter, it just doesn't matter. >> i think you are absolutely right. i mean, he really does lead from behind. that's why the optics are so bad. i'm not sure that whether he was on the golf course or in the situation room of the white house would have made one bit of difference on the ground. >> bill: it wouldn't have. >> on the ground.but, it doesn't look good and it sends a message that we don't care enough about what happens in your country that i'm going out to play golf. so, it doesn't look good for the president. i want to get back to the fact that i don't think it was an accident. i don't think optics are necessarily an accident when it's at that level. i think he was saying i'm aloof and i am not getting involved in this one. don't forget, a lot of critics have said over the past year or so that president obama never spoke out publicly about the excesses of president morsi. so now that it hits the fan and it's going south, you think he's to be in the middle of that? he would rather be out on the golf course than in the middle of that. >> bill: i think it's more than just egypt though. it looks to me and this is pure speculation. it looks to me that the president says, you know what? i won twice. i don't have to run again. i'm going to do what i want. if i want to play golfwhile morsi is, you know, in some dirty cell in cairo, i don't care. i think you are right. he doesn't care about morsi. play a little golf. because, what's it to me? >> let me tweak that just a little bit. i think this is somebody who wanted very badly to be president of the united states. but i don't think he likes having to do the job of president of the united states. that's sort of a drag, you know? i mean, you have got to do all this stuff that a guy like obama doesn't really like. i think he really is too cool for school very much of the time.

because the rules are so complex. >> i have an accountant. >> you don't want to do it yourself. >> i have no idea and i promise this is true. >> he does my taxes. i don't want to pay him but i have to

wendell holmes once said taxes are what we pay for a civilized society. liberals like to cite that but he said that in 1927 when taxes were just 10 percent of gdp. that is enough to pay for a civilized society but government has grown so far far, so fast it is now spending 40 percent of gdp. is too big but i do want to to pay my fair share.what is fair? i now give most of my income to the government. pork people pay a smaller percentage of those say that's fair. budget congressmen louie gohmert says it is not fair and that means what? >> when people hear the word fair share it should be a flat tax the only way to truly make things fair so that if you make more you pay more make it a flat tax the president -- president has talked repeatedly about warren buffett not paying their rate as the secretary. fix it. make capital gains 15 or the income tax 15. we can work out a number but make it flat to make it fairyou hear people say i want it fair but they cannot tell you what the fair share is. you give them the numbers of the top 1 percent making 13 percent of the many that paying 39% of the taxes the eyes crossover but is it fair with everybody paid the same rate across the board? they say yes. i think americans are ready. john: i am skeptical providing most would say warren buffett has billions of dollars, he should pay more than i do. >> that is absolutely right to. he should pay more. john: i need a higher percentage. >> that would be progressive and that plays into people's jealousy. i don't want to go after millionaire's more than anyone else. we need a flat tax. people don't mind if you would see they don't have all the deductions and wiggle room and would be inthe same position as everyone else. john: when you talk about the flat tax you talk about getting rid of deductions and just keep charity and mortgage interest deduction. >> everything else is gone. if you would design a system that would allow maximum corruption, maximum lobbying efforts and fund-raising in washington you created a system just like we have for it is so complex, we have got to fix it. it cannot keep going like this. >> that the complication is with the stupid deductions and exceptions of graduated progressive tax rate is not that complicated. >> the way the wealthy have not been fighting so hard against the progressive right is they have the loopholes and the wealthiest will stop fighting so hard if they have the same levelplaying field as everyone else and people would except that the leadership has not been willing to push it and i think it is a no-brainer we should push it. john: thank you congressman t. levin steve forbes and are laugher and those who have pushed from before me. john: we will hear from him later. what i hate even more is the complication. i resent i have to pay bob for the hours he spends doing my tax forms. but i have to because there is no way i could do mine on my own. the federal tax code is 70,000 pages long. 70,000 pages. this is just what the fed does and state and local does more. they all have some purpose to penalize behavior coming anchorage and other but the results is insanity that helps the politically connected.people in the know like me. the tax rules once gave me a free tax -- golf cart because john -- charlie rangel said it was a good thing. >> energy efficient cars such as plugging in a car. >> they could advertise free cars. >> for $6,000 get a $6,000 tax credit. i got this totally free. >> but the taxpayers paid for its. >> and i gave it away. and that credit no longer exists but things like that keep the tax code complicated this is just the income tax. there are sneaky taxes that most of you may not even know about that. >> we pay them all day long from the moment i wake up and turn on the light. i pay more when i brush myteeth, license my dog, my building pays property taxes and when they leave home to take the subway i paid the metropolitan commuter one negative commuter tax. i make phone calls or get a bite to eat, soda and drink drink, when a gas up my car as much as one-quarter of the price is the state and city excise taxes. people pay sales taxes all day long. so many taxes. i need a drink. i am lucky i don't smoke. this is one reason american economic growth has stalled says scott hodge president of the tax foundation. when i think of these rules i think of safety regulations and the constant spiderweb not the tax code. we have done okay with the tax code.>> the tax code is a mess because of the 70,000 pages that dictate virtually every aspect of our lives and cost americans 6 billion hours of our time just to comply. six out of 10 of us pay someone else because not only so complicated we are afraid to make a mistake to get audited. it has created fear as well as complexity. john: so those six out of 10 could have used that money and time to boost the economy to do something useful? >> i is called deadweight loss. it cost $200 billion per year just to comply with the 70,000 pages of tax regulations that is why the economy grows so slowly. john: they are popular. steering people to good things, solar panels on the roof of your house to get a credit if you adopt a child child, congress passes thesethings because people say that is fair. >> they sound great by themselves but if you put them together it creates a complicated mess to dictate every aspect of our lives and made the irs with the super agency where we put our kids in day care to a hybrid vehicle. john: why is it nuts if you want people to put kids in day care that need the help or to buy a hybrid vehicle how else do you steer them there? >> is years the economy in the wrong direction why the economy grows so slowly because we dictator lives to the tax system not what is economically efficient or profitable. that is what drives the economy and with other countries have done to streamline their tax system like hongkong. 15 countries across the globe have moved to the flat tax.hong kong has so low rate, a broad base no negative tax or capital gains or other taxes that create the economic inefficiency. john: to be clear they don't have a flat tax but it is a simple tax. russia, estonia have 15 or 20 percent flat tax. >> exactly. john: hong kong women from poor to rich in a few years. they grew out of poverty because of simple rules. >> that made them one of the most business friendly economically efficient countries on the globe. john: the tax foundation says we have no deductions? >> there are a few there are some like having a deduction for savings we should not tax back or capital gains but get rid of the politically directed. john: charity? >> the tax the nation is acharity under the tax code but i would give that up for the flat tax. john: billing to give up money for the flat tax to do know the irs used your tax dollars to produce a ""star trek"" parity? >> it has resulted in a widespread case of confusion >> the secret tax is a obamacare and people who profit from the complex tax code. >> the affordable care act means big changes this year when you file your taxes. when you file your taxes. i read the whole 900 pages. [ birds chirping ] i'm your hot water heater. you hardly know i exist. that's too bad. 'cuz if my pressure relief valve gets stuck...

image that supposedly is the tax hike on the wealthy. if you make over $250,000 your medicare tax you pay a premium zero point* 9%. it goes up by almost 1% then there is a tax on investment of three point* 8%. john: obamacare it has the high medical bill tax? >> right now you can deduct medical expenses if they are over seven point* 5% of your income but obamacare raises the threshold that 10 percent so you are sick with high medical bills next year you cannot deduct nearly as much money. john: and the mandate penalties that says i will not insure my people i will just pay the penalty. >> it is the tax.>> the supreme court says it is a tax. the penalty tax will raise about $50 billion over 10 years and penalties paid by businesses who don't buy insurance. you have to or pay the penalty. john: we just cover four or five out of 20. it is so complex h&r; block made a commercial to capitalize on the complications of obamacare. >> be affordable care act means big changes when you file your taxes. i read the whole 900 pages. i will give you a tax and health care review. i know the law. i have the solutions and can help you figure it out. john: she is smiling. a big grin. i invited h&r; block to talk about the gloating but they did not respond. they are happy becausecomplexity we have to pay them. >> this turbochargers tax complexity. you have to figure how much subsidy you are due in did you don't buy insurance homage of a penalty you pay. that is really complicated if you have an insurance gap of three months or less you don't but if it is more you do. if it is an exempt category you don't have to do either. it is so complicated that the application form is 21 pages long because they need to know how much income. john: i hate it. most americans have to go to someone they do not do the taxes on their own. thank you. john merline from ""investors business daily."" a new version of star trek?paid for by the irs, bayou. you will not believe what they do with your money. >> with the planned attacks according to the leaders they have created an arkie chaos roll over order. ♪set it off like a score alert ♪ beep beep what?

With Judge Jeanine : FOXNEWS : February 3, 2013 12:00am-1:00am EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,"well. greg think it is dorky, but going well on itunes. >> i would help you with the styte tells. >> i am doing 12 of >> judge jeanine: i don't love guns. i don't necessarily like guns. i'm a city girl. more comfortable in high heels than boots. and although i had a pet pig for 20 years, that is wilbur right there, and worked in a dairy as a kid, i own guns. long guns. handguns. i own guns because it is my right. it is not a right any one in washington gave me. it is a natural right. confirmed by the very people who founded this nation. it is a right that no one is going to take away from me. hello and welcome to ""justice."" i'm judge jeanine pirro. this week the debate continues injuries the rhetoric more heated as parents in newtowntestify about innocent children taken from them. as sheriffs across this country threaten the arrest of any federal agent who would enforce unconstitutional gun laws as police chiefs support the ban on assault rifles, politicians threaten gun manufacturers and the very banks that fund them and as gun associations sue to protect their guns. cachophony of voices louder and louder at times drowning out the issue on which we all agree, stopping the senseless slaughter of innocence. the president wants to ban assault rifles. he wants to limit high capacity magazines, do background checks and close gunshow loopholes. the truth? banning weapons to prevent crime doesn't work. no where is that point more evident, mr. president than in your hometown chicago where in spite of the ban on handgunsmore people were murdered in the last decade than the number of americans killed in afghanistan. and afghanistan is a war zone. last month in your home city with one of the toughest gun laws in the nation, 42 people including that 15-year-old majorette who performed at your inauguration were murdered. and of those murdered in chicago in the last decade less than 1% of them were killed with a long gun. so i guess that handgun ban isn't working out so well. the bottom line, criminals get guns. law abiding citizens get killed. why would you give the criminals an advantage over an unarmed citizenry? hell, why not just post a map like the journal news did and identify where people without guns live. and rahm emanuel. another member of that chicagooutfit has the huztpah to threaten banks. you say that chicago is leading the effort to keep communities safe? rahm emanuel, what standing do you have to lead any anti-gun initiative? your city is the murder capital of america. leading the way? where are you going to lead them to? you want to stop law abiding citizens from owning guns while at the same time the obama administration was sending free assault rifles to the mexican drug cartels that they then use to kill us. and here in new york mandatory jail time if you are arrested with a loaded gun. loaded illegal gun. sounds good. the problem? fewer than half of those arrested for illegal possession of loaded handguns even received a state prisonsentence. mandatory all right. unless a judge doesn't think they are. you you could drive an 18 wheeler through that old interest of justice excuse to not jail someone. and now the president wants to have a dialogue and mental illness. we know the virginia tech shooter and the colorado movie theater shooter and the gabby giffords shooter each had serious mental problems or were declared to be dangerous. even the newtown shooter who played violent video games for days on end had mental problems. it is interesting that the president mentioned nothing about violent images and video games. if we ban assault rifles then shouldn't we ban the images of assault rifles in movies and video games? what is that you say? the first amendment protects free speech? of course, it does. and the second amendment protects my right to bear arms.neither trumps the other. and by the way, what is with this proposed mental illness database? who should be in it? the mentally ill? the mentally defective? those with a criminal record? those likely to engage in crime? those involuntarily committed? the ones on psychotropic drugs. many states don't even report federal convictions let alone reportal health data. i don't want to forget hppa. my healthcare system so to locked down my other mother's doctor won't even tell me somehow she is doing. we need to prosecute gun crimes. we need to contain the dangerously mentally ill where they are shooting people, killing them, killing them with cars or pushing them on to subway tracks. i have fought for civilconfinement of the dangerously mentally ill. i didn't say mentally ill. i didn't say homeless. the supreme court of the united states has said that civil confinement of the dangerously mental ill is constitutional. kansas versus hendricks. go look it up. i have been in the trenches for decades. i have seen what criminals can do. the pain of those affected by those massacres s palpable through all of us. but law abiding gun owners did not pull those triggers. the founding fathers were forward thinking enough to sea we have the right to bear arms. they didn't say a musket or a rifle with a bayonet. they said arms. i have a natural god given right. i don't have to explain whether i'm hunting deer or defending myself. who should say that i can only defend myself with a certain number of bullets?should i empty my clip and just wait for the end? i have the right to protect my family and myself. i don't love guns. but one day i know i may need them. with me now is syndicated columnist and political commentator ann coulter and fox news contributor pat gudel. good evening, guys. >> good evening. what an opening. >> judge jeanine: am i right or am i wrong? >> needless to say i agree with every syllable of it and to add to it your point of it it being a natural god given right. that is the point of the constitution and all of the liberal law professors, at the university of texas and most recently kale lamar at yale university keep saying oh, no, this is a right for the militia. they say sorry i'm a lebron ral i wish this weren't true.but the right of the people mean exactly as you say. a right that preexisted the constitution and the constitution is merely acknowledging. >> judge jeanine: and saying we are not going to infringe upon it. pat? >> we have a revolution. we passed the second amendment. people knew why they had guns. that was how they protected themselves is from tyranny is what they believed. it was so clear what was meant. the militias, everyone in the villages. the arguments against. what we have here is for a long time people who are anti-gun who think they are evil have been trying to undermine the second amendment. what i love is when the aclu as a friend of mine once said, oh, i know you people, you are the people for all of the bill of rights except the second amendment. >> judge jeanine: right, right. >> this is a de facto way to try to get at that. i never understood the argument. it is ridiculous. >> that is why you are our favorite democrat. >> it is the historical truth. that's all.>> i thought you would go back to your democratic roots on this one. >> judge jeanine: maybe he is going back to his constitutional roots and whether we are republicans or democrats. this stuff from rahm emanuel from the mayor of chicago when says and pat, what do you think of this guy? the city of chicago is leading the effort to fight guns. are are you kidding? he should take care of what is in your own backyard. >> this man has a rolling ongoing massacre of young children in chicago. it is worse than any city without any gun control in america. and he can't do anything about it. so what he does and this is the the rahm emanuel remember who said those famous words never let a good crisis go to waste. and what we have people pulling off the shelf everything they have been trying to do without solving the problem. and hissing about after the banks in the typical style of what i call chicago gangster politics, we will go after anybody and promote anythingexcept he can't stop the violence and killing in his own city and he is going to lead the actual effort? >> judge jeanine: why do you think that is? i was a judge and a prosecutor. you commit a crime you should go to jail. what is going on in chicago? >> they are not allowing the law abiding people to arm themselves for one thing. there are dangerous ghettos in chicago. >> rahm emanuel shows up with the bullet proof glass and says nice to visit your neighborhood now, i'm going home. >> judge jeanine: we know where the crime is occurring in chicago. on the south side. the gang members, why is this girl sitting in a park at 2:00 in the afternoon being gunned down. they know this. why aren't they doing something? >> liberals don't have a very good record on dealing with crime. that being the case is citizens out to be able to arm themselves the same way up a emanuel's body guards are armed. >> somebody is not stopping the gang violence.we had it when i lived in l.a. they still have it. not at the level of the deaths going on here. and of children. and yet they are unable to either prosecute, put away or deal with or change the circumstances. if i were the mayor that is what i would be involved in. >> judge jeanine: what about this idea that the president has about the mentally ill. let's do a database of the mentally ill. we don't even know in new york half the people in jail are mentally ill and we are letting them out. >> it is the right target. completely the wrong remedy. >> judge jeanine: how do you do it? >> the way we did it up until 30 years ago there was civil commitment. the book the insanity offense and it has laid out clear guidelines of exactly what happened in america 30 years ago when first california and then the rest of the states started ended civil commitment. the homeless rate went through the roof. we are seeing that. >> judge jeanine: we are worried about the nut jobs they let go.>> the homicide rate has gone down. the number of massive shootings has gone through the roof exactly as we have is an explosion of homeless people. we are talking about the mentally ill. >> we went too far are in deinstitutionalizing. that was an instinct we shouldn't keep people locked up. some people need to for their own protecon and their own life. >> their harm more than -- >> it is about what they -- he won't speak about hollywood or video games because of the money and i hope we deal with that. >> judge jeanine: it is appalling. ann, pat, thanks for being with us. the new york rifle and pistol association and the westchester county association filed a complaint against the state of newark regarding the new strict 2013 again law and will there be a fight if the feds try to enforce new gun laws. two of the country's toughest lawmen coming up. and later live on the scene ofthe alabama hostage standoff. hostage negotiators hard at work trying to free a five-year-old boy. stay with us. in america tay we're running out of a vital resource we need to compete on the global stage. what we need are people prepared for the careers of our new economy. by 2025 we could have 20 million jobs without enough college graduates to fill them. that's why at devry university, we're teaming up with companies like cisco to help make sure everyone is ready with the know-how we need for a new tomorrow. [ male announcer ] make sure america's ready. make sure you're ready. at devry.edu/knowhow. ♪ at devry.edu/knowhow. all right that's a fifth-floor probleok.. not in my house! ha ha ha!ha ha ha! no no no! not today! ha ha ha! ha ha ha! jimmy how happy are folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to geico? happier than dikembe mutumbo blocking a shot. get happy. get geico. fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more.>> judge jeanine: this is a fox news alert. on the ongoing hostage situation in midland city, alabama where a five-year-old boy continues to be held in a secure underground bunker. reports are that jimmy lee dykes the man accused of holding the boy has allowed police to deliver coloring books, medication and toys forhim. that, of course, a good sign. we will be live on the scene later in the show to bring you the latest on the negotiations. police working very hard to free this boy and return him safely to his parents. now, back to guns. the obama administration is pushing to restrict gun ownership. if that happens will those laws even be enforced? sheriffs in 39 states say they will not only not follow the laws, they believe that those laws will violate the second amendment. with me are are maricopa county arizona sheriff joe arpaio from phoenix and ken christian is sen from santa fe. thanks for being with us. >> thank you. >> good to be with you, judge. >> judge jeanine: you not only believe that the proposed federal gun regulations are unconstitutional but youindicated that you will not allow federal agents to come to your state to enforce those laws. why is that? >> well, judge, we are are not going to enforce those laws and we are is certainly going to do everything we he can to protect the citizens of new mexico. i am extremely proud of the sheriffs from the new mexico sheriff's association that stood up with me in the capital earlier last month and stated that we would not enforce those laws. >> judge jeanine: and sheriff arpaio you have been called the toughest sheriff in america. what do you think we he should do to get illegal guns off the street? >> we should enforce the laws if it is illegal, protect the constitution. throw some extra years at people that use weapons in the commission of the crimes. and be vigilant. don't ignore information you get from people that are going to do havoc like in the recentsituation in connecticut. i sent out my volunteer armed posse over 500 to patrol the schools and by the way, i have the third largest sheriff's office in the country with 4 million people with thousands of federal agents. i don't think i'm going to lock up federal agents but i'm not going to knock on doors to take guns away from private citizens. >> judge jeanine: sheriff, do you think that that is what the so-called federal gun grab is? it will be a door are to door search for illegal guns? >> i don't know about regular guns. i worry about the ban on semi automatics because there s a ban if congress passes that are we going to worry about the feds saying we are going to knock on every door and recover all of those rifles? i am never going to do it but i have a little -- i worry a little about that happening. so we have to fight back. protect the constitution. and make sure that we do the --we follow the constitution and that s what this sheriff is going to do. and i have to give appreciation to the other sheriffs. in all we have 3,000 sheriffs in this country. so i have to say that a few of the sheriffs are are coming out like in new mexico. i wish all of the sheriffs would come out on this matter. >> judge jeanine: and sheriff christiansen do you think there is a difference between urban and more rural areas in terms of the breakdown as to whether or not law enforcement believes that the ban on assault weapons or proposed ban is legal? >> i do. i think in the cities it is another problem all together. but in the country and urban areas it is a different situation. sheriff joe is right and by the way you hit it right on the head in your opening about everything that sheriffs are talking about across this country. you know, these federal agentsthat people talk about, they are friends of mine. many of them are friends of mine and they also took an oath. they are not coming to anybody's house taking guns away. i'm afraid these laws are just not going to been forced. we had plenty of laws right now that aren't being enforced on a daily basis. >> judge jeanine: and what is interesting is that all of you took an oath to support the constitution of the united states and the laws and constitution of your individual states. it will be a very interesting showdown. but hopefully it won't even be a showdown. anyway. thanks for being here. >> thank you. >> thank you. >> judge jeanine: coming up a wisconsin sheriff says you you better arm yourself because 911 might not save you. he is with us.   and later, that heart breaking hostage situation continues in alabama. we will bring you the latest. stay with us.♪ ♪ call 911 shorty on the dance floor, whoa ♪ >> judge jeanine: one milwaukee sheriff is making a bold statement about 911 not being your best option. take a listen. >> with officers laid off and 911oughed simply calling and waiting is no longer your best option. beg for mercy, hide under the bed or fight back but are you prepared? consider taking a certified safety course and handling a firearm so you can defend yourself until we get there. you have a duty to protect yourself and your family. we are are partners now. can i count on you? >> judge jeanine: the milwaukee county sheriff david clark, jr. thanks for being with us this evening. >> judge, it is my pleasure. >> i have to tell you that is avery interesting psa, public service announcement. what caused you to actually do that announcement? >> well, the back drop is this. we had severe public safety cuts both the city of milwaukee police department and the milwaukee county sheriff's office. we had rising response times. 52 minutes to respond to a burglary. this is through no fault of the officers. a lack of political commitment by the elected leaders in wisconsin who have abandoned not only the street officer is but the citizens as well. the concept that an individual doesn't play a critical role in their own protection is foreign to me, as a matter of fact. personal safety s an individual responsibility. part of my job is to give people the honest truth of what is going on and i have operationallized two important things that have gone on in the state of wisconsin recently. a doctrine that protects home owners in their home should anintruder come in and the personal protection act which allows citizens to apply for a permit and arm themselves. >> judge jeanine: interesting. most people think -9d 1 911 ise end all. i was looking at the lawsuits where the police haven't been a dispatched or one person calls after he has been shot. 7 minutes later he calls again he has been shot and now he is is running down the highway and then heard being shot to death. i mean cases like that are not unusual. but no one has taken the stand that you have which is let's level with the citizenry and in fact i think that it was your mayor who said something like do we have a sot on that? no, we have the full screen. apparently sheriff david clark is auditioning for the next dirty harry movie. hthat is the mayor. what say you to that one? >> i wasn't surprised. i was hoping to hear somethingcoherent and logical for the mayor. he s part of the reason why that the area is in the plight that it is. you know, judge, that personal safety is not a passive activity. we need to engage citizens and the more we empower people to play a role in their own personal safety the better community milwaukee is going to be. >> i assume, sheriff, when we talk about a ban on assault rifles and a ban on handguns like in chicago and washington that is not something that you are in favor ever? >> not at all. i trust law abiding is citizens. i trust law abiding citizens to go armed. what i fear, judge, is a criminal perpetrator with a gun. what i fear is a lenient prosecutor's office and a lenient judiciary who will not enforce vigorously the laws on the books that will send a different message to the criminal element that that kind of activity is not going to goon. >> judge jeanine: i want you to take a look at this homeland security video real fast. the department of homeland security says what we should do if a mass murderer comes in. do we have that one, guys? >> if you are caught out in the open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover, you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available. to protect your hiding place lock the door if you can. block the door with heavy furniture and close, cover and move away from windows. hide behind large items such as cabinets or desks. >> judge jeanine: sheriff, if you heard it they said grab scissors. i mean are you kidding? this is the department of homeland security and they are worried about people defending themselves with guns. sheriff clark i assume that you don't think grabbing a scissor is a good idea if someone is coming at you with a gun? >> i saw that the other day and i laughed. dhs is out of touch. i like to think that i have my finger on the pulse of what goes on at the street level with both the officers and thecommunity. again, i'm not afraid of empowering citizens to make critical decisions and i don't want to sit here and tell people in this situation do this and in this situation do that. that is whew i emphasize it is an individual responsibility. people have to make the best determination with what they are are faced with on the ground when the situations arise. the thought of grabbing scissors in that situation i think is laughable. >> ridiculous. i will say it for you. sheriff clark, i couldn't agree with you more. thanks for being with us. we would love to have you on again. >> judge, it is my pleasure. >> judge jeanine: do gun buybacks work? vote on facebook or on twitter @ judge jeanine. and a new segment on justice. creep of the week. our first creep is rashaud green of ohio. this upstanding citizen's ex-tried to get a restrainingorder against him in domestic relations court. now, as you can see from the video the magistrate who i will get to in a minute leaves green alone with the woman seeking the order and his grandma and that s when things go to hell in a hand basket. green chases her around the room, knocks her to the ground and starts pelting her. and because i can't help myself, that magistrate tracy stoner who isn't a real judge s my sub creep of the week for leaving them alone in the first place. who is dumb enough to do that? but alas only one creep of the week. rashaud green congrats on being the first to take top honors. my viewers will decide what your prize should be. send me a message on facebook or tweet me at judge jeanine and let me know what you think rashad's prize should be. and coming up we are live from the scene of the dramatic host and situation in alabama.   and later, benghazi was badenough and now other u.s. embassies may be in danger. sometimes what we suffer fromis bigger than we think ... like the flu. with aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. so why treat it like it's a little cold? there's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. prescription tamiflu attacks the flu virus at its source. so don't wait. call your doctor right away.tamiflu is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. before taking tamiflu tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. if you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking tamiflu and call your doctor immediately. children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. the most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. the flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about tamiflu. prescription for flu. that your mouth is under attack, from food particles and bacteria. try fixodent. it helps create a food seal defense for a clean mouth and kills bacteria for fresh breath. ♪ fixodent, and forget it. c'mon0manp just do it.ú no one's watchingp ♪musicú ♪musicúgood job   live from america's news headquarters i'm lauren green. this time tarlgiting a top social media, twitter reveals 250,000 accounts were cracked open, exposing e mails and private pass words. the company has reset the stolen pass words. earlier in the week ""new york times"", washington post and ""wall street journal"" reported their own systems had been hacked. just days before president obama heads to minnesota to discuss gun controlz the white house release aid photo showing the president shooting at clay targets on a range at camp david. gun rights advocates say one picture does not erase hisrecord of supporting legislation. i'm lauren green, now back to justice with judge janine. judge. >> judge jeanine: this s a fox news alert. the standoff continues in alabama where jimmy lee dykes continues to hold a five-year-old boy hostage in an underground bumpinger. let's go now to the -- bunker. go to garrett on the scene in midland, city, alabama with the latest. what is the latest? what is going on there? >> reporter: good evening, judge. authorities are continuing to release very few details about exactly what is happening there at the bunker. in fact, the press conference we were expecting to happen here in about 30 minutes was just canceled. and that has really been kind of typical the last few days. earlier today police did tell us that they have been in constant communication with the 65-year-old man jimmy lee dykes who they say shot and killed a bus driver before taking a special needs child down intothe underground bunker on tuesday afternoon. we are here on another chilly night. the fifth night that the child has been down there. police told us earlier that dykes is helping to keep him warm with electric blankets and heaters he has down there and also allowed police to deliver some toys and coloring books to the young child as well as medicine and potato chips they just told you us. they are grateful for that that he is helping to teak care of the child and keep him in good health but they are are still hoping to reach some type of resolution. the next update we are expecting will be tomorrow morning. and also happening tomorrow is the funeral for the bus driver how many in this community are calling a hero for dying while trying to protect the kids on his bus. >> judge jeanine: garrett, let me ask you a quick question here. is there any relationship between this jimmy lee dykes and the child that hekidnapped? >> authorities have not told us anything about that relationship, if there is any. we still don't know. that is one of the many details we are waiting to hear. exactly why it is that this would happen. we do know that jimmy lee dykes was scheduled to go into court on wednesday. >> judge jeanine: for what? >> for some -- he was scheduled to go there for menacing with neighbors. lots of the neighbors we talked to people here as well as in the community said he wasn't the ideal neighbor. people called him just a mean man. he is very protective of his property from what neighbors have said. any time someone or an animal would get close to the property lines he would either fire a gun into the air or become very aggressive and near violent with them. so that s what he was going to be in court for on wednesday. we don't know if that is related. authorities have not said. again we are still waiting to find out many of these things and frankly many of them we probably won't find out untilafter this whole thing s resolved. >> judge jeanine: garrett, thanks so much. with me now is former fbi lead international hostage negotiator chris voss from d.c. and former hostage negotiator scott wagner are with me here in new york city. chris, it is day five. what is taking so long? >> well, they have to show him that the they patient. i'm sure he has a vision of a possible negative outcome by authorities rushing in and attacking him or assaulting him in some way. they are reassuring him and showing him that they have all of the patience that is necessary. they will hear him out. the fact that he has taken all of the defensive measures and this is all about him being very defensive indicates that he would just as soon live if he could. and it is just a matter of them ultimately reassuring him and earning his trust so that he comes out. >> judge jeanine: we just heard scott from the reporter thatthis child is eating potato chips. i mean do we have any idea why this particular child? >> well, not that we have been made aware. we have the president has been kind of held at a standstill as to what has been going on. we do know that the individual has accepted medications that the child is needing. and that is a good sign. >> judge jeanine: i understand that he suffers from aspergers which is at one end of the autism syndrome. >> that is what s reported, yes. >> judge jeanine: you are a negotiator. what do you say in a situation like this? five days. >> as long as we are are talking and we are communicating that means it is positive. the situation hasn't had to escalate at all. it is basically at a stable position right now. they are are talking. and as long as people aretalking -- >> judge jeanine: 80s' good. he is antigovernment and antiauthority. >> apparently. but then again he -- we don't know what his fears are. we don't know what his demands or wants or needs are. in order to negotiate with someone in anything you have to know what they want. what are their wants. >> judge jeanine: chris, do we know what he wants? >> well, ultimately what he wants s to be left alone. and all of the things that he is against it is amazing the amount of things that that is the starting point for conversation because you could find out what happened to him, why he is against those things. you you begin to ask him questions about well if you are against this what are you for on the other side. so as much as we know about him it is amazing how much there s actually to talk about this and find out what really makes this guy tick. >> judge jeanine: one of the things that we know, scott, is that they are not allowing the parents to talk to the child. we do you think that is? >> the negotiators have to control the setting and the screen. >> judge jeanine: this poor five-year-old. he is a baby.>> when you introduce the parents or any unexperienced person into a setting like this you could and tate unwillingly or unknowingly. you don't know he what issues the is subject has with his own mother or his own father or his own parents. obviously he is aware that he did something wrong. >> judge jeanine: he killed a bus driver. >> he is aware of what he did and that is in the past, its' done. now, what's done is done, let's move on and now let's work through the situation where nobody gets harmed. >> judge jeanine: chris, last question to you. how long can this go on? you know, without the jimmy lee dykes doing something, i mean how long does law enforcement wait? is there an answer? >> open-ended. law enforcement is going to wait for as long as it takes. there is no reason for them to go anywhere. they are not having any trouble controlling the scene. they will do whatever is takes to save this little boy's life.>> judge jeanine: let's hope that that happens. thanks for being with us this evening.   coming up, in the wake of benghazi and the attack on the embassy in turkey, how safe are our embassies around the globe? and later, you won't want to miss what sean smith's mother has to say about hillary clinton. or that printing in color had to cost a fortune. nobody said an all-in-one had to be bulky. or that you had to print from your desk. at least, nobody said it to us. introducing the business smart inkjet all-in-one series from brother. easy to use. it's the ultimate combination of speed, small size, and low-cost printing. yeah, i'm looking to save, but i'm not sure which policy is right for me.you should try our coverage checker. it helps you see if you have too much coverage or not enough, making it easier to get what you need. [ beeping ] these are great! [ beeping ] how are you, um, how are you doing? i'm going to keep looking over here. probably a good idea. ken: what's a good idea? nothing. with coverage checker, it's easy to find your perfect policy. visit progressive.com today.this week another attack on a u.s. embassy. this time in ankara turkey that left an embassy guard dead. the latest attack along with the benghazi massacre and reports that security at our embassy in afghanistan may not be sufficient begs the question. is this administration turning a blind eye to the safety of our diplomats. with me is former cia operative mike bake fres baker from boisdphares. are are our embassies under a greater threat now than ever before? >> they are certainly under a greater threat not because of the inner ring meaning the protection of the embassies. what walls should we build, how many security guards. that is uniform across the web of our embassies but because of the outer ring. who are the enemies. in libya for example the idea that the militia that were not really considered 80s enemies were the ones who attacked us should raise a flag and in other places around the world what the u.s. government needs to do s to understand what are the networks at play. in turkey, for example it is not just the local left wing militia that i would be concerned about but the penetration coming from iran and syria. so the outer ring seems to need growing in threat against u.s. embassies for private institutions for that matter. >> judge jeanine: and mike there is a report that says aprivate security company hired by the state department to protect american diplomats at arguably the most at risk u.s. embassy in the world failed to adequately train employees and on and on. does that surprise you, mike? >> no. i hate to say it doesn't necessarily surprise me. and i agree with whalid that we are currently looking at a much more dangerous environment for u.s. facility is overseas. it has always been dangerous whether talking about the tower bombings or the east africa embassy bombings, karachi, beirut. i would argue that the past four years sort of our policy is particularly in the middle east and asia have created inconsistencies and sort of emboldened i think some of those hostile against us. the report that you are tacking about in kabul unfortunately over the past ten years because of iraq and because of afghanistan in particular we had to rely more on privatesecurity companies and also local personnel. >> judge jeanine: mike what you are saying s if we rely on private security companies we are paying them and if we know that the host company in the february 17 brigade in benghazi could care less and are are infiltrating, why don't we is send our own guys there? what s that about? >> i'm saying this as an owner of a large information security company and i have had a lot of experience in some of these locations. but when you are talking about running a private security company you are talking about the bottom line. adding mo more people and adding more training and adding more quality eats into the bottom line. that is a problem. what we should be doing and should have done years ago given our time spent in iraq and afghanistan is we should have been looking at the military as let's build up not just the marine security guard program but you a separate cad ray also charged with protecting some of the high threat areas in a more robustway. >> and whalid one of the things that hillary clinton said as we stepped down yesterday she implemented all of the arb recommendations. do you buy it? >> the enemy knows all of these recommendations. the jihaddists are not dumb and they understand how we protect ourselves. in the area where the embassies fortresses they willres they not send a brigade to attack us head on. not just the inner wall we need to look at but the strength and capacity of the enemy in striking in different countries. ail geary it was not even protected and we had citizen there's. we need to have a more intelligent intelligence in the situation. >> judge jeanine: no doubt. thanks for being with us this evening. >> thank you. >> judge jeanine: coming up, her son was killed in benghazi and now sean smith's mother responds to hillary clinton'stestimony. this is america. we don't let frequent heartburn come between us and what we love. so if you're one of them people who gets heartburn and then treats day afr day... block the acid with prilosec otc and don't get heartburn in the first place![ male announcer ] e pill eachmorning. 24 hours. zero heartbur>> judge jeanine: and now this week's in stam insta poll. do gun buyback programs work? most of you are not buying it. laurel says watch we may have another fast and furious out of all of the buybacks. >> joe says yeah to go by a newer and better gun. jack says if the intent s to retrieve legal guns from legal gun owners it probably works to the extent of disarming grandma and grandpa and all of the liberals know that these cranky old fools shouldn't be armed. car sarcasm intended. and tim p. says yes to some degree. any gun you get off the street is one less that can murdersomeone in the hands of a crazy person. is it enough? no. the problem is too great. eileen says yes as you you have is some grenade launchers you want to unload. otherwise it is a waste of time and money. i'm with you, gun buyback programs do work. i ran a gun buyback program when i was d. a. but you nbuer saaw you anything like this one. a missile launcher turned in during a gun buyback program in seattle. one less miss is sill launcher on the street. don't you feel better now?

welcome everybody. good to have you. good luck getting folks to leave home. not if a new study says welfare related benefits are topping $38,000 in several states. that doesn't mean that everyone getting welfare is lazy. but i trust a good nanny can do math. the math doesn't make it all that compelling to get off the couch. to ben stein, melissa francis, along with adam lashisty. charles, what do you make of this? >> i talked about this a long time. i've been blasted on comedy central for being heartless. the fact of the matterers i'veseen it in my own eyes. >> medal of honor, wow. >> they figured out what we already know about you. >> all right. >> john, go ahead. you were saying. >> the bottom line is it's just, listen, we should be making it where people are urged to get off welfare instead the idea of making it comfortable. i've always said they made poverty comfortable enough not to get off of it. it's not the one where they pay for the house, food, rent, cell phone and sit at home and make a lot more money than people doing minimum wage jobs. it's simple math and it crushed generations of people. crushed them. >> it does make it tough to leave that because even if it isn't exactly the same, child care issues, it doesn't have to be. it's daunting. >> in new york, especially. you receive the benefits, of course, you're not getting taxed. in new york, you have to make $21 an hour in order to takehome the same amount of money as if you were on all these programs. and then i mean because they're talking about a single mom with two kids, you also have to find someone to watch your kids. so it's just impossible. the real thing is then you have no incentive. how are you going to go from a total stand still of having no job at all to leaping up to a job where you make more than $21 an hour? that's impossible. >> you have to make sacrifice and transition. >> that's what people have to be incentivized to understand. the first step you take an economic hit. now you're in the system. now you work your way up the system. it's a hard sales pitch. >> whatever happened to the welfare to work program? >> welfare reform, right? in the early 1990s, you had all the great thinkers, people saying we need to change the system. we need to incentivize people to go to work. deincentivize people to stay home and collect welfare. in five years, barack obama has essentially changed that. we are now going away from -- >> this trend has been going on through the bush administration, as well.but i guess this time -- it's a bipartisan sort of a rant here. benefits are out of control. ben stein, here's what i heard from a lot of folks who were noting fox is condemning this new trend. well, obviously for reason to dramatically hike if not double the minimum wage. what do you make of that? >> well, that's a good way to double the unemployment rate. i mean the situation is very difficult for poor people. we can just start at the beginning and say if you're a poor person, if you're a person who does not have much education or much ability to earn money, you're screwed no matter what you're doing. you're not going to live well on $38,000 a year. you're not going to live well on $21 an hour. you have to go back farther and start explaining to people they must get education. education is the capital from which people build careers, lives, homes, families. that somehow has to be drummed into people's heads. we don't know how to do it.we don't know how to do it. >> i don't think we should be incentvising people to do this stuff that puts them into welfare. >> having kids, starting a family -- >> that's one of the problems. you get paid more money when you have more kids. >> go ahead. >> ben was starting to make an important point which is we sort of -- >> then i guess he did. >> i'm going to finish. >> all right. >> we overgeneralize. ben said it's hard to have a good life on $38,000, especially in some of the states that we showed on screen. we're also overgeneralizing here. these programs are not a bed of roses. it's not like you sort of lounge around eating bon-bons. and the check shows up. they check up on you every day. >> what, go out and do push-ups every day? you get the money, dude.you have to enroll in the program. you have to participate. you have to check in, et cetera. >> oh, come on. >> if we're saying that our public policy should be to encourage people to work, to not work, i completely agree. by the way, i think most people who were on welfare would rather have a job, would rather have that good feeling that you get from working. that's absolutely what we should encourage. >> i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. i hope that is the case. what worries me is we live in a society where at least some of the major protests over the last year have been for government aid and benefits and not for jobs. >> exactly. or to skew the pay system somehow so that the kid who drops out in tenth grade can be rewarded at the expense of someone who worked their way through college. i have to disagree with adam. the way it works, it's not just one person in the house over $38,000. there are two or three brothers and a mother. soon the household income gets around $70,000, $80,000. people can buy $200 sneakers. let's talk about the real world for a minute. deincentivize. how do you do it? i know too many people who dropped out of school won't take a job at mcdonald's. they tell me flat out. they want to work.they want outlandish salaries. for their skill sets. >> how difficult is it to get into the programs? >> you can get a new phone almost every month. go back to the program with a new cell phone. >> fill out a few papers. that's a big thing is absurd. >> the bottom line is the benefits are very generous. they're getting more generous to adam's point. i don't think they're life sustaining. they're clearly not. i think it's very hard to breakaway when they get so generous and to your point on childcare issues, you actually can make a very good math argument not to, right? >> you can make a fantastic math argument not to. it's impossible to go from that stand still to having a job where you make more money. like everything else, it goes back to parents trying to teach kids the only way they get ahead and sustain a middle class life is to get out there and get the first job and get promoted and get the n one and work their way up. they have to accept that no matter what you can get for free, it is not as much as can you do on your own. you have to be willing to work hard.>> i'm sorry, ben. charles wrote a brilliant thing about this in his book and experience growing up in harlem. it does get to be a cycle, doesn't it? >> it's generational. it's a shame. it's sold as a way of caring for people when, in fact, at some point you're not caring for them because you're enabling something that -- see, the idea that people won't ever live the american dream or attempt to is heartbreaking. it is called subculture poverty. sociologists have been talking about for years. if you incentivize people to do things, they keep them in poverty. like having kids out of wedlock, they stay in poverty. >> i know. but it's not realistic we're going to break this cycle any time soon. any time you talk about changing this, what are you going to take the food out of the single moms with kids? no one is ever in favor of that. any time you want to cut back on programs -- >> rudy giuliani did. >> so if that is the case then ben stein, where are we going with this? >> we're in real trouble.americans are not acquiring human capital in the form of education and skill sets to use charles' very wonderful phrase that is going to build this country and build up self-esteem and self-worth of the people of this country. we have a whole culture that's not starving but it's starving for self-esteem. they resort to violence, drug addiction, premarital and extramarital sex. we have a whole culture that is just dying from lack of self-esteem and that's from lack of work. >> people like him perpetuating it, right, adam? >> i know you don't want to comment on that for me. >> i don't, indeed. stick around, we're going to take a break.   in the meantime, no way to the nsa. why the lawmakers are saying the best way to defund the agency right now. the ""cashin' in"" crew is all over it at the bottom of the hour.   one of the largest stock exchanges stopped cold for threehours. they're calling it technical difficulties. when i first felt the diabetic nerve pain, of course i had no idea what it was. i felt like my feet were going to sleep. it progressed from there to burning... to like 1,000 bees that were just stinging my feet.

>> well, the only way that there would have been something like this happening if there was the crisis and lots of live human traders and they the question -- >> that happens sometimes. >> the question we have to ask, it could happen. ask us how much better off are we with the computer system? i don't know that there has been any data showing we are better and there is more liquidity and prices are lower for the investor. for the very long run, stocks are certainly a heck of a lot better than the ordinary investor. >> but does it inhibit trading? you don't see it in volume figures, but could it inhibit trading? >> listen, it could be really bad. by the way, studies all over the place on net net, which is better the humans or the computers. yes, they'll say more liquidityand you can trade easier so it's better. but execution and all these other factors go into what are stock prices. i will say this, though. i think the nasdaq did a great job with the big guys. they did a great job talking wall street and they did a great job with the regulators and dealt with the issue pretty well. like put a cork in it very well. they dealt very well with their big customers and list of companies. >> two e-mails. >> you got two e-mails. >> i guarantee the apple people were on the phone. >> i'm telling you, it's how in 2001 and the computer has just started taking over here. >> but it hurts the retail guy. that's who really got screwed here. the average investor sits back and says, why am i in stock? i'm not a guy that pumps stocks up, but doesn't take a rocket scientists to figure out it went from 6 to 15 in a couple years. if you were out of it, you missed making a lot of money. >> we like to have people think at home it does take a rocketscientist. >> it actually doesn't. >> well, that's good. >> when we come back, the people working here can learn from this college sophomore in atlanta. still listening, washington?

three dozen people in the zimmerman case and found no evidence that race was a factor in the shooting of martin. and in discussing the zimmerman case last year, holder himself said to bring a federal hate crime charge, the government would have to prove the highest standard in the law. >> we have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with the requisite state of mind. >> reporter: at the white house, jay carney said president obama is staying out of the decision. >> he will not comment on a department of justice investigation. or on the decision that thedepartment of justice will make about how to proceed, if to proceed. >> reporter: the president certainly did not shy away from commenting last year less than a month after martin died. >> if i had a son, he'd look like tray van. >> reporter: today carney denied those comments put any pressure on the justice department. >> the president commented on the death of a young man and the pain that his parents were feeling and he commented in very personal terms. >> reporter: tomorrow holder heads to from a for the naacp annual convention in orlando. that's just a short distance from the courtroom where zimmerman was found not guilty.   it's been said that famous people, celebrities, are at least partly responsible from turning the case from a local matter to a global one. howard kurtz looks at how that same culture handled the jury's decision. >> reporter: all the media speculation about whether georgezimmerman's acquittal would lead to violent demonstrations turned out to be mostly wrong. but many news outlets are still providing a forum for those who go beyond criticizing the verdict to making sweeping statements about race and violence. al sharpton, who crusades against zimmerman on his msnbc show, despite his involvement as a civil rights activist, is calling for new protests. >> i can tell you this is long from being over and we're going to be with them every step of the way because this puts every child at risk. >> this is just another piece of evidence on the in-controvertible contempt that this nation often shows and displays for black men. >> reporter: every child at risk? now the anger is understandable. trayvon martin was armed with nothing more than a bag of skittles when he was killed. but even as most legal analysts believe that zimmerman received a fair trial, daily news chose to likening him to a lynching victim.and social media has shown its ugly side. a press reporter tweeted so we can all kill teenagers now? just checking. she apologized for what she claimed was a bad joke. and two pro football players have said they're sorry for their twitter comments. victor cruz saying thoroughly confused. zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him. and

to have spurred a whole new round of divisive coverage. >> and zimmerman's attorneys are speaking out about the media coverage. >> well, they will go aggressively after nbc for the misleading and inexcusable edit being of the 911 tape.the same time the fact that george zimmerman was acquitted of murder doesn't mean that he didn't do anything morally wrong by going after an unarmed teen age.

planning document obtained by sky news indicates the attendees are worried about the development of schisms amongst thebrotherhood's leaders and rank and file, that they see the movement also suffering from, quote, fragmentation and that they hope to combat these trends in part by means of subterfuge. the document recommends brotherhood supporters publish files to expose corruption by the egyptian military and other opponents of the deposed morsi government and suggests amplifying the statements of senator john mccain and other u.s. lawmakers who have described the army takeover in egypt as a coup. >> they are going back to what had been their previous strategy for getting into power in the first place, which is to work secretly, to defame and spread distortions and lies about their enemies. to spread division among their enemies. this is precisely why they have fallen because they didn't understand the mistakes they were making. >> reporter: as american policymakers navigate the choppy water, they strive to avoid any show of favoritism toward any faction.but bill burns today pointedly did not meet with the muslim brotherhood. and he hinted strongly washington's dalliance with the brotherhood is over. >> we hope it will be a chance to learn some of the lessons and correct some of the mistakes of the past two years. >> reporter: at the same time, burns and

to blow up the senate. but senate democratic leaderharry reid says he'll bring up several nominees tomorrow and if they're not approved, he'll move to change the rules. >> we have a responsibility to give advice and consent to the president on his nominations. but all we have from the republicans is ob structure and delay. >> reporter: republicans tell a very different story. mitch mcconnell says president obama has not been deprived. >> the president has had 1540 of his nominations confirmed. only four defeated. he's not lost a single member of the cabinet. he's getting them faster than president obama was at the same time in his second term. >> reporter: the so-called filibuster means that a single senator from either party can object and confirmation requires 60 votes. but senator reid calls many things filibusters that are not. >> first time they filibusteredthe secretary of defense. >> reporter: republicans, however, say some senators severally ask for a floor debate on hagel after which he was quickly confirmed. reid promises any rule change will have limits. >> this does that affect life time appointments, substantive legislation. >> reporter: one republican argues once it's been used for nominees, yp for other matters. >> that may be true initially, but once a simple majority has been used to impose culture for executive branch nominees, why can't it be used for judicial nominees that have a lifetime tenure. why not use it for every day legislation. >> reporter: when republicans thought about rule changes when democrats were blocking bush court nominees, reid sharply criticized the idea. >> the filibuster is far from a procedural gimmick. it's part of tfabric of the institution we call the senate. >> both parties at times have considered changing the rules and wisely reconsidered. >> reporter: and at this hourall senators are meeting privately in the search for a compromise. some ideas have already been floated, but senator reid isn't bunchdging so far.

make almost 40.   now to another hot button topic. opponents of what they call the amnesty provision in some immigration reform bills rallied take here in washington.karl cameron is here to show us what happened. >> well, immigration reform is off to a pretty slow start in the house and isn't expected to come up for a vote until after lawmakers month long august recess. so if anything is to pass, it will have to be while congress is also dealing with all the budget and fiscal crises. not easy. a group called the black american leadership alliance held a jobs alliance urging to reject the reform bill as a job kill foreblack american workers. some heated rhetoric. they invited the most vocal opponents in congress to blast the senate passed bipartisan bill as an economic disaster. >> if this bill were to pass, wages would go down. unemployment would go up. and the gross domestic product per capita would be down for 25 years. it's a hammer blow to american families. >> the charge that more hispanics in the workplace mightactually be bad for the economy overall drew a bipartisan reduke from rahm emanuel and grover norquist best known for the no new taxes pledge. >> immigration is what makes us the future, not europe, not japan, not china. and we do it better, smarter and get back on track to where we've historically been. >> in the city of chicago, about 50% of all new business applications are by immigrants. and that's why i've always said you cannot be pro small business and be anti-immigrant. >> the clock is ticking and the odds are getting longer that the house will have a real difficult time passing immigration bill. first they have to work out the differences if they get it passed in the house, they have to work out the differences with the senate and then get something to the flad can actually be signed. the crunch is because get an agreement will be even tougher next wreer when lawmakers will be facing re-election. it's kind of a now or neversituation

this is the fbi looking at it independently. they have determined from interviewing nearly three dozen people in the case that racial bias was not a factor. what is the open civil rights question? >> well, that is a question the department of justice will answer and the department of justice appropriately handles these investigations, reviews the evidence. and makes determinations about next steps. that's not something that we do from here. >> george zimmerman saturday night cleared of murder andmanslaughter charges in florida. state court. but u.s. prosecutors and today the attorney general eric holder saying that they may pursue criminal charges under a federal hate crimes law. here is what the attorney general said back in april of 2012 about the standard, the bar that you have to clear, to get a conviction on hate crimes law. >> for a federal hate crime, we have to prove the highest standard in the law. something that was reckless, that was negligenecigent does nt that standard. we have to show there was specific intent to do the crime with the requisite state of mind. >> so with that, let's bring in our panel. busine bill crystal, marra lion, and charles. charles. >> we saw every minute of the trial. there was nothing secret. nothing hidden p so for all of those who want to make it anexample of racial prejudice, answer this. where was the racial taint in those hours and hours of trial? what parts of the trial were not part because the victim was african-american? the way that these demagogues are comparing this incident to emmitt till who was lynched in the south half a century ago is a travesty and a desecration of the memory of till who was the victim of real brutal racism in a country that at the time had legalized racism. here was a trial that everybody watched and that was without any doubt a fair trial. i think the media's attempt to turn this into a racial incident is disgraceful. the paradigm is white on black except zicmmerman is hispanic. so cnn and others had to inventa new category, the white hispanic. why? presumably one of zimmerman's parents is white. that also applies to the president of the united states. which means is he a white african-american? it's an absurdity and disgrace. >> obviously the naacp is calling for this. al sharpton, others calling for federal prosecution on civil rights case against george zimmerman. and 600,000 signatures on a petition so far. >> yeah, and i think that really shows you how upset a lot of people are about the outcome of this trial. however, when you listen to eric holder and that bite you just played, he described all the reasons why probably they won't bring this case because it's justi ismpossible to win. could you make the argument that the prosecution's case in florida was impossible to win. when you have a law that says you're allowed to use a gun in self-defense if you, quote, feel threatened and it's up to theprosecution to prove that you didn't feel threatened which i think is an absolute impossibility, then you couldn't convict george zimmerman. so i think the focus should be on the law, not on whether there was a miscarriage of justice in the trial. >> you mean the stand your ground law. which really didn't factor into the case but -- in and the whole self-defense definition and what you have to prove to show that it wasn't. >> bill, one of the biggest hurdles may be the fbi. they're interviewing some three dozen people and they found no evidence apparently that race was a factor in the shooting of trayvon martin. >> and the whole thing is -- i can't believe, first of all, and i have high regard for eric holder, but i can't believe they would bring a case. it would be such a disaster in terms of what it would say about the lack of rules law in the united states and the ability of demagogues to bring a case afterthis, after a trial that was televised and not a tainted trial in any way. the whole principle of modern liberal democracy in the nation in which we live is to separate politicses from criminal court cases. ancient greece, criminal trials were part of politics. if you didn't like the party the guy on trial was from or his class that's how you carried out political vendettas. the whole point of modern liberal democracy is to say, no, we'll have impartial judge, juries of our peers. race doesn't matter. we won't litigate all the other issues we have through persecuting one person or acquitting one person. you can't get in the game of having the naacp or any other group saying this guy should be prosecuted, this guy should be convicted. >> the president's statement sunday dealt with calming people down but also had a political tinge to it towards the end before the death of trayvon martin was a tragedy. he goes on not just for hisfamily or for any one community, but for america. but then later says we should ask ourses if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence, we should ask ourselves how we can prevent future tragedies like this. that's a job for all of us, that's the way to honor trayvon martin. is there a sense in that statement and perhaps what you're hearing at the white house that the gun effort is going to reemerge? >> i think that the white house would like to try again on gurps. it's just really hard to see how they do and what's the vehicle and what has changed in the senate since the first time they tried and failed. i don't really see an opening for them. but i do think that these protests have been -- i haven't heard of a single violent protest. the parents to their great credit called on the protests to be peaceful and called for calm reflection. i do think that what can't be dealt with in the trial as billsaid is the widespread almost universal feeling in the black community that if trayvon martin wasn't african american, this wouldn't have happened. and that's something that has to be addressed not in a courtroom, but it has to be addressed in some way. >> they were largely peaceful protests. oakla oakland, california had some vandalism. but largely peaceful. charles, last word. >> i thought the president's statement was exemplary. he tried to get in a promo for gun control, but that's a minor offense. of the major issue of race, i thought he handled it extremely well. it was a tragedy that should never have happened, but it was not at least as the jury have said, not a criminal agent. and i thought that the president in saying a jury has spoken said a lot and it helped to calm the waters. >> we should say there is one picture that has been put up and this picture is believed to be the last picture of trayvon martin before the shooting.some nine days apparently from his family's posting on facebook. any other pictures that are out there that you think are real probably aren't. next up, a makeover for the muslim brotherhood. all business purchases. so you can capture your receipts, and manage them online with jot, the latest app from ink. so you can spend less time doing paperwork. and more time doing paperwork. ink from cha. so you can.burns. traveled to egypt and he method with officials there. of the interim government in egypt. saying that the u.s. is going to be supportive of egypt's efforts to set up a government quickly. we're back with the panel. charles, what about this meeting of trying to reverse the muslim brotherhood's fortunes? >> it's very interesting that it's happening in turkey. i think that the hand of the turks is extremelyimportant here. heir to one the president of turkey sees himself as the new successor of the oat man empire. controlled the arab world half a millennium. what air to one has done. he sees turkey now as the great guarantor and ultimately the senior ally of the muslims, the sunni muslims and he has seen the brotherhood in gaza, in egypt, in northern africa, and even the brotherhood in syria and the civil war. as the instruments of this resurgents of turkey -- in the region. they had their high moment with the election of morsey and then within a year it's all dissolved. and that, i think, is the great reaction now is there any way to salvage this. is there any way to restore them to power. i'm not sure the answer isyes, because the brotherhood would have to go to war as the brotherhood did in algeria in the 1990s and lost it. it looks as if they are going to go underground instead. sn. >> in this document sky news obtained it suggests, mara, that brotherhood believes the only countries it can really trust are turkey and cut tar. >> well, they are getting support from both of them. certainly al jazeera has been -- it's even being accused of being so pro-brotherhood quit based in cut tar and supported by the government, the problem in egypt is that the muslim brotherhood doesn't really believe in democracy. certainly the military doesn't. but the liberal secular forces are totally disorganized and can't win an election. so, if you are going to have some kind of reconciliation. some kind of national unity government. the brotherhood is going to have to be part of it in some way. i don't really know how this gets resolved. right now we are back to where we started. we very a militarygovernment in egypt. >> bill? >> i'm heartened that if this document is correct and accurate and information some sort that the muslim brotherhood thinks that the coup in egypt was a real blow to the muslim brotherhood and morsi's ability to governor by a very very narrow margin behind him. if he failed, that's a good thing. i hope we aggressively push to support friends elsewhere in the region who are neither military or muslim brotherhood. at times you have got to pick the lesser of military. the military maybe is the lesser of two evils in this case. they do seem intent not to try governor forever and hand it over to some kind of civilian leadership. i think people have been much -- the arab spring happened. great, wonderful. democracy. a later, it's horrible, arab winter. nightmare the muslim brotherhood gorching everyone. it's a complex region. turmoil after being frozen and amber for 30, 40, 50years. people should be calm, be patient, it does mean the u.s. can in a lot of indirect ways and some direct ways try to play an active role and i think actually the president sending deputy secretary of state burns to cairo now was a good thing. >> bret: is it fair to say and some of the criticism coming from egypt and what was the opposition now heading towards interim government was that the u.s. ambassador ann patternson really went out of her way to meet with muslim brotherhood leaders even outside the government almost too much so and not much push back from back here in washington to say you can't relationship up up -- rupp the constitution and supreme court in egypt. >> to fatal itsist sense. only game in time nice to them. maybe bill burns showing up today is a sign they learned a bit of a lesson. >> as he said himself, time to do some things over and get them right. >> particularly on our part, the administration had got it wrong for a year. the morsi administration when it supported him. now i think it's getting itright and to quietly supporting the generals at an attempt to put together an interim government of -- instead. >> bret: that is it for the panel. stay tuned to see somewhat of a media frenzy.>> bret: finally tonight, the royal baby is due today. the duchess of cambridge otherwise known as kate middleton is on the clock now and the world media is standing by to get a first glimpse of baby cambridge. one intrepid journalist was on the job to try to show the absolute frenzy. >> this is the -- kate is due to burst any minute now. i want to show you how many interest there is in this royal baby. take a look at the media poised for are that historic moment. >> there must be 1, 2, 3 guys out there. >> one guy was opening a sandwich. i mean, it was -- thanks for inviting us into your"

fox news extreme weather alert. the massive clean up under way in the northeast. a mess, following the historic blizzard that dumped nearly 3 feet of snow. the storm can blamed for at least five deaths, including a five-year-old boy in boston. right now crews all over the northeast are hard at work, trying to restore power to as many as 345,000 people who still don't have heat or electricity. there's also a race to get the highways and public transit systems up and running. the morning commute coming tomorrow.   we have mother fox news alert. in details emerging in the manhunt for a fugitive ex cop in southern california. authorities created a new taskforce to coordinate search efforts for this man, former los angeles police officer christopher dorner. dorner, accused of murdering three people, just in the past week. one, the daughter of a retired police officer, her fiance and another police officer all as alleged payback. investigators have been focuses on the snowy mountains northeast of los angeles. welcome to a new hour of america's news headquarters. >> it's great to have you here. fox news has newly released video of dorner showing him training during his time on the police force. he posted an online manifesto and claimed his career was ruined by racist colleagues. the chief of police ordered a review of that case. we're joined from los angeles. the chief -- is he saying whyhe's ordering the review at this time? >> hi, yes, the chief here in los angeles did talk to a local affiliate about what prompted his decision. here's a portion of that interview. >> i'm not doing this to appease him. i'm doing this so the community has faith in what the police department does. and i'm going to make a rigorous inspection to either validate or refute his claims. we'll make that inspection public. >> reporter: dorner claims and blames numerous people in the department for his firing in 2008. and according to police and his online manifesto he's seeking revenge for what he saw as unfair treatment when he turned into a fellow officer for behavior during arrest. he was fired forgiving false statements. he's a highly trained individual, serving in thepolice department and naval reserves. he also as flight training so it prompted the department of homeland security and t.s.a. to put airports and airplane owners on alert. >> at this point, given what they know and are looking at. where are they in the is investigation? still only in california? >> no, it's not only in california. it is in three states as well as northern mexico. however, it's almost as if he has vanished. police have said in his burning truck that was found in big bear, investigators did find weapons inside and police in irvine did execute a search warrant on a storage locker that belonged to him. items were removed, however we do not know what they consisted of. law enforcement in arizona, nevada, california and northern mexico are in on the manhunt. the u.s. border patrol is on alert, looking for dorner. one big concern for tonight inparticular is that he is here in downtown los angeles for the grammy i awards, held at the staples center. there's always a big law enforcement presence but tonight the los angeles police department is very concerned and they have extra security out there, road blocks are already out because, as you know, the police department has been named as a target. >> everyone there certainly has to be on alert. thank you very much. we'll check back with you as the investigation develops.   now back to the great sunday cleanup across the northeast following the historic blizzard. some places piled up an inch of snow an hour. in connecticut, a record 34 inches snow dumped across the state and paralyzed travel to the point the national guard was brought in to help.   anna, the ban on travel waslifted in new england. what's going on in connecticut? >> reporter: in massachusetts and connecticut, the travel bans were lifted but the governors are urging residents to stay off the roads. things are still a mess. in milford, connecticut, 38 inches on the ground. records were broken. 40 inches in some places. when you get this snow, not the only do you deal with hours of tireless shoveling and plows trying to make it through and then to the side streets, we've had reports of roof collapses. 345,000 homes and businesses are in the dark. that means they're without heat and many are using generators. the governor of connecticut is urging folks to be wary of carbon monoxide poisoning. >> if you are out power, using a generator or other heating source, please make sure it is vented and vented isn't having it in a detached garage.it has to be vented outside. >> the storm is blamed for at least five deaths in the united states. one an 11-year-old boy in boston, massachusetts, who was in the car, overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning while his father was trying to dig out snow. >> that's so tragic that that young boy was in the car, maybe the tailpipe of clogged. the governor of connecticut wants assistance from the federal government? >> yes, asking for resources, more than money. new york'sgoer is stepping in, saying he's offering power crews and plows to come in to massachusetts and also connecticut. new york didn't get hit as hard add new england. still, long island in particular, 150 cars stranded on the long island expressway and resources from upstate new york are coming in today with road graders. we have new pictures we'reshowing you right now of them trying to get things up and running. until 5:00 today, portions of the lie are shut down. it's a mess for a lot of folks, neighbors are helping neighbors dig out from their homes. >> we are headed down to dig out one of my friend's sisters, she has asthma and she can't get out. >> reporter: 5300 flights have been cancelled but major airports are running. 400 national guard members are on the ground helping too. >> thank you so much.   as the northeast is recovering from our first big winter storm, there's at least one other on the way elsewhere. rick reichmuth has been so busy in the weather center. >> another one in the center part of the country but it's come to get northeast tomorrow. temps today, everybody in the20s. still below freezing. notice over the next couple days our temps will climb. we're going to be in the 40s tomorrow. that might sound good but it's going to rain and that's a problem. it stays in the 40s the next couple days but the snow is light and fluffy. if you shovel it now, it's easy. a little bit easier. tomorrow when it rains, it will soak that water like a sponge and the snow will become incredibly heavy, almost impossible to move. today i can't urge you enough to get your roofs cleaned off and everything shoveled because roofs tomorrow will likely collapse. later this week. cold air comes back and everything will freeze. you got to do it today. this is the next storm, bringing blizzard conditions into the northern plains today. another blizzard here. winds very strong, 40, 50 milesan hour and maybe 12 inches of snow on the northern tier. that storm is moving across the south, bringing severe weather. a tornado watch until 2:00 p.m., later on moving up towards the east a tornado threat and then tomorrow, rain for parts of the northeast. >> is it warm anywhere? >> very nice in florida. got a great day in florida. that's why they're there. >> thank you.   a fox alert. new developments breaking from a powerful member of congress, a republican senator, on two of the president's nominees for cabinet post. senator lindsay graham believes the senate should hold up the confirmation ofs of john brennan an chuck hagel until the white house releases more information on the deadly benghazi forattack. senator graham wants to know exactly what the president was doing that tragic night. >> i don't think we should allow brennan to go forward for the c.i.a. director ship, hagel to be confirmed to secretary of defense secretary of defense. did the president ever pick up the phone and call anyone to help these folks? >> what does this mean? joining us, a former media spokesperson for president george w. bush and joe mansion a democrat. mercedes and chris, welcome. mercedes, let me start with you. what does this mean if the senator is saying we're going to hold up these critical nominations until we find out about the president's activity that night? >> we've been waiting for months from the white house to figure out what happened in ban gaza. when you look at what susan rice mentioned on benghazi with her talking points, that basicallysaying that this was due to a protest. we know that wasn't the case. we've had so much misinformation coming out from the white house and from the administration, and when you look back at panetta's last week in the hearing when he said he called the president at 5:00 and didn't touch base with him again. it's a fallout from the president being too focused on the election, not taking care of the embassador and our folks out there in benghazi that unfortunately had to die because of this. >> chris, do you think it's the president's fault, that he was too focused on the election and didn't do anything else that night? >> you know, i think it's easy to be -- it's a cheap shot. the reality is and the administration has been clear, mistakes were made. secretary -- former secretary of state clinton testified multiple times, she talked about what happened. there was -- she took responsibility for this terribleevent. there was an investigation independent in terms of what happened and how to prevent it from happening. it seems strange at this moment that senator graham is decide to go put a hold on this. to be honest, my opinion, it has more to do with the fact there's a serious division between former senator chuck hagel, a republican, and his republican brethren. it doesn't make sense this is the one that you decide to hold up on. >> senator graham has been specific and blunt and critical of this white house. he says the white house, as it relates to the president's activities, has, quote, delayed, denied, deceived and stonewalled. that's pretty tough. >> let's say for argument's sake you're right, it has nothing to do with senator hagel. why not put a hold on senator kerry? he's the incoming secretary of state. if you feel so strongly about the fact you need more answers, stop playing politics.the reality is it has more to do with the fact senator hagel and senator graham and senator mccain, the little group, doesn't get longwell. >> do you buy that. >> that's true. they have huge questions or senator hagel and his positions on how he would handle foreign policy, particularly with opposing sanctions on iran and north korea and israel. with that said, it was the secretary of defense secretary of, they did not do enough. so i think that there's these questions that need to be answered. as we know, it's been fox news covering this issue, ignored by the mainstream media. this is a moment in time we've loved an -- lost and embassador and several americans. >> one phone call, 5:00.>> one phone call. >> the white house would say the president was briefed by advisors. you served the president, george w. bush. >> that's right. when dealing with an attack, when american lives are in harm's way, we know that becomes quicklily a high priority for the president. if we know -- we know there's an attack going under way. >> what should he have done? >> i really think you have to step aside from being so focused on the election at that moment in time and make this one of your top priorities. >> should he have been back in the oval office behind the desk? >> absolutely. that's what you see with any major attack. september 11 was a massive attack, but when we're looking as an american embassador to died and nothing was done, there was no military that was brought in at the time, absolutely. that's a moment when you have to put aside the politics and bepresidential and get your secretary of defense in your office. >> chris, is it fair to say nothing was done? what would you like to have seen. >> it's not fair to say nothing was done. the president does not sit there next to the phone. he's got incredibly well qualified individuals to deal with these crisis when they happen. secretary of defense was involved, secretary of state. were mistakes made? absolutely. makes that should never happen again. there was an independent report done to highlight the mistakes and to make sure that we don't have this type of terrible tragic again. the notion of months later, now you're going to hold up two potential key positions in the president's national security team because you don't have enough answers, it smells more of politics than pursuit of truth. >> that has to be the last word.thank you very much.   right now president obama's preparing for his first official trip at president to israel. will it be enough to repair his rocky relationship with prime minister netanyahu. former israeli embassador to the united nations, dan gillamen weighs in. gentlemen, valentine's day is less than four days away. coming up, how you can really outdo yourself this year without breaking the bank. i gave birth to my

>> for roses, stick to the local florists or warehouse stores because you're going to score a better deal. there was a study from cheapism.com that showed the average price of roses in new york and california was $50 compared to 60 to 85 at the major online flower retailers and you score a better deal at local places. especially if you bargain with them. what if the flowers come damaged or late?

83% say yes and 14% say no. more say cutting government spending will likely strengthen the u.s. economy. that's 73% to 15%. will it? look at the clicking national debt clock. it's like a las vegas slot machine. with us, one of the u.s. senators will it attend the state of the union. angus king, independent of maine. >> great to be with you. i saw you had john bolton on. i don't think you should have eand i on the same program. i've been many for him in airports. >> i'm glad you're here. in dealing with the deficit, dealing with this spending, wejust saw the clock, going and going. what do you think the president should say? what would you like to hear tuesday? >> let's talk about the spending separately. what i would like to hear is proposals for strengthening the economy. the debt and deficit problem is also a problem of economic growth. we don't have too many economic problems that a few extra points of gdp growth wouldn't solve. the economy is sort of okay, improving. housing is coming up. the stock market is doing well and manufacturing is coming back to life. if we can get the economy moving in a positive direction that will help with the debt and deficit and other issues. i want to hear concrete proposals for creating jobs and expanding the economy. >> how do we get there? you've been in washington, you're an independent. the parties are like this. >> no kidding. >> did you expect it to be thatbad? >> i didn't have any illusions but there are a few signs of hope. negotiations on the filibuster rule change. didn't get as much as i want but that's compromise. a bipartisan serious discussion on immigration. i don't think we expected that. let's hope there's positive movement. but yeah, the warfare is still a big part of the deal. >> it's on both sides. the critics accuse of president of my way or the highway yet john boehner will not sit down with the president one-on-one about the fiscal mess. can there be a breakthrough? what will it take? >> i think is there could be because the outlines of a potential resolution are out there. interesting discussion about spending. it's absolutely true, spending's a problem. but it's not in the areas people think. what they call nondefense discretionary spending, which wethink of as the federal government is the lowest percent in 50 years. defense is about where it's been. actually lower than the past 25 or 30 years. where the growth -- two areas of huge growth, one in healthcare, and that's medicare, medicaid, other health expenditures and the other in tax expenditures, deductions and loopholes which doubled since 1986. if we get go back to that level with deductions and loopholes that's almost as much as as the defense budget. >> what would you do? you were governor. as an independent for two terms, you had to balance the budget in maine. >> we had -- there was no such thing at deficit spending. >> should there be that in washington? >> i've often -- all my life i've said balanced budget amendments are gimmicks.shouldn't have to do it. i'm rethinking that position. i think there needs to be some external discipline. all the governors have to balance their budgets and they manage to do it. sometimes it doesn't make people happy, but you do it. i think a carefully crafted constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget over time, allowing for emergencies and recessions and those kinds of things, i hate to say it but i'm coming to believe that it's necessary. it's too easy to spend and too hard to tax and you end up with a deficit. >> how about those who say it's unrealistic, you could never have a constitutional amendment balance that. >> i'm not sure. a lot of people around the country, political war horses like me are changing their view. it seems it's become a very, very difficult to make the difficult decisions.we could surprise the public over the next couple weeks, but sometimes i think of the -- our political system like wiley coyote, we throw anvils in the air and act surprised when they hit us in the head. this is a artificial deadline and will squash us. people don't have much hope. colby collins had this poll. it was released last month. 61% of folks think it's very or somewhat unlikely that elected officials can work across party lines. 26% say it could be likely. how do we switch the numbers? >> the odd part is it wasn't always that way. one of the reasons i ran for senate. i worked in the senate in the 70s and saw senators of both parties argue, disagree, compromise, which is part of governing, reach solutions andmove the country forward. it doesn't have to be the way it is. the reason it is is a complicated mix of things like jerry man dering and money in politics and changes in the media but it involves people sitting down, listening and respecting one another. my father used to say you can disagree with people without being disagreeable. it's time for more of that. >> finally. senator lindsay graham is making news saying he wants to put a hold on the chuck hagel and john brennan nominations until he finds out more about what the president was doing the night of benghazi attack. >> i was in the hearing last week in the morning with secretary panetta and general dempsey and they were asked what the president knew and they answered clearly. they were meeting with him at 5:00 and just got word about benghazi. they informed him and he said essentially deploy whatever resources we have to in order to deal with it. >> do you think that was enough?>> well, senator graham's question was did he call later or what did he do? i'm not sure -- they're fair questions, but to put a -- i'm not a fan of one senator holding up a presidential nomination. if he wants to make his argument on the floor of the senate, have an up or down vote because those are important jobs. it's not going to help us in the c.i.a. or defense to not have the new nominees in there. so i'm entirely supportive of senator graham's opportunity to raise the questions but he should have put the hold on john kerry, that's where the -- state department is where this occurred. >> are you troubled by what the president may have done or not done or are you satisfied? >> i would like to hear more about what the follow-up was. on the other hand, the president issued the order, deploy thenecessary resources and then as dempsey and panetta testified, there was follow-up with the white house staff. i'm not sure the president needed to be on the phone every minute monitoring it. but i think -- i think it would be nice for us to know, but i don't think it's -- rises to the level of holding up two cabinet nominations. >> senator angus king on the deficit and your first state of the union as a senator. thank you for coming in and braving the snow in new york. >> good to see you. >> thank you so much.   for a look beyond the news, liz trotter's sunday commentary. >> president obama will deliver historic blizzard state of the union speech tuesday. you might ask, why do we need one? are america people to starved for the president's words and images that another scheduled prime time photo op is urgent?does a week go by when we don't see him on television? according to a survey, the president has delivered a total of 1,852 speeches, remarks and comments. about a third of the time using a teleprompter. even as tv ratings go south, the state of the union remains a political day of obligation, a relic of a less flashy time. no one should question the legal argue. the president shall from time to time give to the congress information on the state of the union and recommend considerations as you judges necessary and expedient. some argue we're well aware of the liberal issues hammered home by mr. obama. immigration, gun control, climate control, more promises to create jobs, et cetera, et cetera. we heard most of this in theinaugural address weeks ago. it isn't as though the speech will write a new chapter. why not abolish it? surely we could get a bipartisan vote on this. the state of the union is andrea tantaros acronysm. well before the inventions of radio and television. george washington started it in 1790 with a personal appearance. in 1801, thomas jefferson decided he would send written notes to congress. jefferson claimed the ceremony was too kingly, too british. ed the colleagues said he was ashamed was historic his squeak. woodrow wilson's speech came into his own when hair harry true man doctors he appreciatedthe showbiz potential. a smiling president offering a outstretched hand as he enters the chamber. it's a major motion picture. on the plus side there have been a few, very few, magic moments in past state of the union addresses such as president kennedy's 1961 pronouncement to land a man on the moon, and george w. bush's reference to axis of evil. two years ago there was the business of supreme court justice samuel alito who said not true as mr. obama attacked the decision on campaign finances. when has truth ever been a concern in this extravaganza. lastly, who can forget bobby jindal and his awkward delivery of the opposition remarks in 2009. undaunted he's working on public speaking to recaptureeligibility for the 2016 national ticket. this year, the g.o.p.'s bright hope, florida senator marco rubio will deliver the republican answer to mr. obama's speech. as the republican not so secret weapon to improve its image with hispanic voters, rubio's speech will be heard in spanish and english, a clumsy idea by democrats. the president's friends in the media have already begun talking about the state of the union, leaking tips on what's to come. everything but the evening's movie schedule. >> president obama preparing for a crucial visit to israel that could reset the strained relationship between the two countries. what do israel leaders need to hear? dan gillerman joins us livenext. to grow, we have to boost our social media visibility. more ""likes."" more tweets. so, beginning today, my son brock and his whole team will be our new senior social media strategists. any questions?

[ male announcer ] fast, reliable deliveries worldwide. fedex.president obama will visit one of america's closest allies, news the president will travel to israel for his first time at president. we're told he'll go next month. today israeli prime minister netanyahu announced iran's nuclear program, a middle east peace process and violence in syria will be on the agenda. beyond that there's a more subtle issue at play. officials say the president hopes to reset his relationship with mr. netanyahu. removing the friction that is said to exist between the two leaders. joining me from tel aviv, former israel embassador, dan gillerman. embassador, good morning, thank you for being here. >> good morning, it's good to be with you. >> i want to ask you, because prime minister netanyahu has been forthright and believesthis spring will be a significant time for iran's suspected nuclear program. how beneficial is it that the president makes this trip now? >> i think it's very, very beneficial and very timely for the president to make this trip in march. it's also very significant and maybe symbolic that the president started his first term with a cairo speech and the second with a visit to jerusalem. it's important and it's a totally different region. he'll be visiting a volatile region with egypt collapsing, with syria in the midst of a civil war, with other countries fighting the extremists or extremism taking over, and he'll be visiting the u.s.'s only ally and friend in the region and probably best friend in theworld. it's a huge to know opportunityr those two leaders who are just reelected and dested to work together, to sit down beyond the pomp and circumstance of a presidential visit, to sit down quietly, just the two of them, look each other in the eye, tell each other what they want to achieve, what they can do and what they can't do, what their red lines are and set on a course of working together in this very dangerous neighborhood and very dangerous world. >> understood, embassador, the president's been pretty clear about what he would like to see, his position has been, correct me if i'm wrong, don't act unilaterally against iran, israel. is there a plan in place for israel to take unilateral action against iran in connection with its suspected building of nuclear weapons? >> israel has always said thatiran is not a threat only to israel and is not only israel's problem. iran is a threat to the world at large and to civilization as we know it. we hope the world, led by the united states, will deal with iran and make sure that it does not acquire nuclear weapons. i assure you, if the world does not and if the u.s. does not, israel will do what it has to do to stop it evil, extreme fundamentalist regime threatening to wipe us off the map and threatening civilization. that option is very much there. i'm sure it will be discussed by the president and prime minister with candor and the prime minister will make it very clear to the president this is an andrea an existential problem and he expects the united states to act if all other measures fail.>> understood. the united nations president make it how clear israel is taking that issue. there will be other topics, the instable in syria is one. also a threat to the region. and the prime minister now has -- he's backed by a new national security cabinet. what difference will that make on all the issues to be discussed? >> well, i think in a way, the president has already made a difference. i think that by merely announcing that he's about to visit israel at the end of march, he has made it very -- he's made the urgency of form agco listening in israel much more so. i think that the are prime minister realizes he should have a government in place and a coalition in place by the time the president and air force one lands in israel. i think that the other partieswho are negotiating to join the -- >> got to leave, unfortunately. we're out of time. but please come back as we get closer to that meeting. thank you. we'll be right back.

Newsroom : FOXNEWS : February 6, 2013 9:00am-11:00am EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,">> gretchen: real estate guru bob massi tomorrow seminar from florida. register, rebuilding your dreams at foxnews.com. >> steve: bobby dean and maria in the after the show show. martha: sounding the alarm on america's spending problem. the non-partisan congressional budget office says we are in for a massive and unsustainable increasing deficit if we don't get a handle on entitlements. good morning. glad to have you with us. gregg: the cbo is saying it deficit will go down to $840 billion. that's the first time it will drop a trillion dollars under president obama.martha: but with baby boomers retiring at the rate of 10,000 people a day. entitlement spending is set to explode. stuart, as we pointed out, there is a lot of enthusiasm that we won't rack up a trillion dollar deficit. >> reporter: the headline was all about the deficit is going to be below a trillion dollars. that's great news. the bad news and there is a lot of it. the next 10 years medicare will cost $1 trillion a year. obama-care subsidies will total nearly a trillion dollars. the cost of medicaid will double and the debt will go to the highest portion of tour economy than it's been in a generation. there is dismal views on thecurrent state of the economy. 1.4% growth this year and the unemployment rate will rise at 8% and stay that way for years to come. martha: the cbo makes very clear we need to do some entitlement work and recraft these programs if we want them to be our for our children. why does the administration not appear to be too concerned about doing that. >> reporter: you have to ask, is deficit reduction a priority of the obama pad min straition? it doesn't seem like it. just yesterday the president was trying to avoid the big spending cuts. he's trying to avoid that. there is a faction within the democrat party that says debt doesn't matter, we have beatenit. whether that's true or not. deficit reduction is not a priority. martha: the president believes the economy is getting back on track. so let the folks decide. stuart, thank you very much. gregg: according to the cbo. by the end of the year the federal debt held by the american people will be 76% of the gdp and it doesn't get much better from there. martha: the cbo also predicting unemployment will be with us for some time to come. here is the director of the cbo. >> under current law we expect the unemployment rate will remain above 7.5%. that would make 2014 the 6th year in a row with unemploymentso high. the longest such period in 70 years. martha: the unemployment rate has been above 7% since december of 2008. and most recent monthly number ticked up from 7.9% from 7.8%. not a good trend. when you look at some of these numbers it makes it a tough argument for economic recovery. but the president remains convinced we are starting to see it. gregg: poverty is up. incomes are down. so the arrow is going the wrong way. in the meantime president obama is asking republicans to delay spending cuts with more tax hikes. there are some liberal democrats who say republicans just want to gut the social programs. >> it's time we take off justthe green eye shade and look at the people behind the cuts that have been made. $600 million cuts to community health centers. that's talking about taking food out of the mouths of babies. i would say mitch mcconnell is a bully. gregg: will republicans go for president obama's deal? martha: there are some tough new questions for the white house after a memo surfaced that lays out the case for targeting u.s. citizens overseas when they believe they are a threat to our country. the critics say it allows the president to be the judge, jury and executioner on americans. now there is a group of senators who say they want answers to this, and if they don't get themthe president's nominee for cia and defense could be held up. >> we conduct those strikes because they are necessary to mitigate ongoing actual threats, prevent attacks and save american lives. these strikes are legal, ethical and wise. the u.s. government takes great care in deciding to pursue an al qaeda terrorist, to insure precision and prevent loss of american lives. gregg: peter doocy joins us in washington. >> the first thing an american citizen has to do to be targeted is associate themselves with al qaeda operations. when they do that the juts is department says that out weighs their right to due process.>> we say that we only take these kinds of actions when there is an imminent threat when capture is not feasible and when we are confident we are doing so in a way that's consistent with federal and international law. >> reporter: a secret justice department memo makes sure there does not have to be a known plot, just an imminent threat to target a citizen aligned with al qaeda. the first to be targeted was anwar al-awlaki. we heard republicans and democrats come out in the last 24 hours and say they don't think decisions about executing u.s. citizens should be made secretly. >> you have a senior unaccountable d.o.j. official that makes the determination recent activities makes himbelieve we are in imminent threat and you can send a drone to kill him. i'm troubled any time government is as non-transparent as this. >> reporter: tomorrow john brennan will come to capitol hill for the senate confirmation hearing. he was president obama's number one counter official terrorism official as the drone protocols grew. we expect to hear u.s. senators bring that up at his confirmation hearing. gregg: the question being asked today, what if president bush had done this? some say he would have been raked over the coals big time for his. martha: the city ofcharlottesville, virginia is the first city to pass resolutions related to drones. originally they tried to make me charlottesville a completely drone-free zone. it's a big issue in this country. gregg: we are learning new details about the end of that hostage standoff in alabama. authorities say accused killer jimmy lee dykes rigged his bunker with explosive and even planting a bomb device in a ventilation pipe that he told negotiators to use to communicate with him. the feds continue to scour dykes' property for more evidence.meanwhile, relative say the child appears to be doing quite well. his mother released a statement. ethan is safe and back in my arms and i owe it all to some of the most compassionate people on earth. i'll never be able to repay those who helped bring ethan home. my family and i ask that you respect our privacy and give us time to heal and time to put this nightmare behind us, time to move forward. martha: thank goodness that worked out the way it did. there was a spoim warning that was can -- there was a tsunami warning canceled overseas because a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck in the solomon island. it triggered a series of relatively small waves. they are located in the so-called ring of fire which hasthe most volcanic activity in the world. gregg: it looks beautiful, but how would you like to live in a ring of fire. martha: the tsunami alert has been thwarted. some new problems for lance armstrong. reports that there is a new investigation that could lead to some serious charges for him. gregg: criminal charges. forecasters from predicting a blockbuster storm. the question is, is it head your way? martha: new allegations of crony capitalism as a big donor and friend the the white house just received a massive contract to give high-end smartphones to the unemployed. but does the program work? remember this from the last election. >> everybody in cleveland gotphones. he gave us a phone. you sign up, you got no income,

[ woman ] we had two tiny reasons to get our adt security system. and one really big reason -- our neighbor's house was broken into. what if this happened here? and since we can't monitor everything 24/7, we got someone who could. adt. [ male announcer ] while some companies are new to homsecurity, adt has been helping to save lives for over 135 years. we have more monitoring centers, more of tomorrow's technology right here today, and more value. 24/7 monitoring against burglary, fire, and high levels of carbon monoxide starting at just over $1 a day. now our best offer has been extended due to popular demand. installation starting at just $49 -- a savings of $250. adt. always there.gregg: police in texas release the chilling 911 call that led them to the sniper. the sister made the call after her brother reportedly confessed to murder. >> my brother just came by here. he told me that he committed a murder. and i'm terrified for my life. i don't know if he's going to come back here. gregg: ralph is a 25 year oldiraq veteran being held on murder charges. martha: cell phone company tracphone will be giving out free phones with internet service to help low-income job seekers find work. but this is not the first time the president has given a business deal to one of his so-called cronies. it was a practice he promised to get rid of it. >> the days for sweetheart deals for halliburton will be over when i'm in the white house. martha: jonah goldberg joins us. you know, i think that these kind of deals have happened over and over and over again. but the difference is that president obama made it very clear in the election he wanted nothing to do with this kind of thing. now you have a good friend ofhis, the ceo of tracfone is a frequent visitor to the white house and they have got a pretty good deal out of this one. >> president obama said no more sweetheart deals for halliburton. he didn't say no more sweet hurt deals for tracfone. it's a pilot program. this program which i think is constitutionally dubious to begin with. the fcc should not have the power to raise taxes by itself. but under this program it's supposed to be for under privileged poor people and unemployed people to learn typing skills and write resumes and they will hand out smartphones which i think is notgreat for typing out resumes. martha: the program supporters say it's a way for the unemployed to learn technical skills to prepare their resumes and search for jobs. but one of the pilot projects went to this tracfone wireless company that president obama is closed to based on their visits to the white house. whether these programs even work, i think everybody would say great. if it gets people jobs and it's truly helpful you could make some good argument for that. but it doesn't appear it does. >> i'm not shire would be entirely in favor of these giveaways if you can prove they work. why are we turning libraries to train people with if the whole idea is to stay on the couch and play with their smartphones andplay doodle jump. my friend and muck raker tim carney says whenever the government gets involved in a new business the well-connected always win. this is a classic example of this. this company owned by a mexican mobile giant 'tise 'tis of -- advertises incredibly aggressively saying do you want a free phone. if this program takes off the company is set to take in $100 million a month from reimbursements from the government. martha: it raises questions about a growing entitlement society as well. the gifts from the government is a way to keep people unempowerred. >> this goes to obama's core philosophy which we heard in the second inaugural and nancypelosi who called unemployment a jobs bill. positive liberty is when the government gives you stuff that lets you be all you can be. that's what obama talked about in the second inaugural. he said all these programs liberate people to be entrepreneurial. my suspicions if you give them free this, free that. it doesn't make them entrepreneurs but it makes them dependent on the government. martha: thank you, jonah. always good to see you. he's a poet and doesn't know it. gregg: another day of dramatic testimony expected in the ex-girlfriend murder trial. she changed her story over and over again about her former boyfriend's death and her latest version of events. save her from the death penalty.>> we talked about it and basically our relationship was over and it was kind of sad. eat good fats. avoid bad. don't go over 2000... 1200 calories a day. carbs are bad. carbs are good. the story keeps changing. so i'm not listening... to anyone but myself. i know better nutrition when i see it: great grains. great grains cereal starts whole and stays whole. see the seam? more processed flakes look nothing like naturalrains.you can't argue with nutrition you can see. great grains. search great grains and see for yourself. for multi grain flakes tt are anxcellent source of fiber try great grains banana nut crunch and cranberry almond crunch.martha: she suffered a terrible crash. word now that olympic ski champion lindsey vonn is out for the rest of the season. sheer to ligaments in her right knee and suffered a broken bone. it's a slow motion replay of what happened yesterday. what a tumble for lindsey vonn who is such a great ski champion. the hope is she'll be back on the slopes. this an optimistic hope. for october in the world cup she says she is grateful for theoutpouring of support and looks forward to competing as quickly as possible. she hopes to be in tune for the sochi olympics. she has a year to rebuild. gregg: her story has changed. more dramatic testimony in the case of jodi arias reportedly after he ended their relationship. her appearance is now different from when she was dating alexander. but it isn't just her looks that have changed. her story has changed. during an early police interrogation she denied killing him. about a month later she claimed he was here he would back up that zwroir. september 2008 her account changes when she claims shewitnessed two other masked people killing alexander and this week on the witness stand she admitted she killed alexander but claims it's self-defense. adam, she was on the witness stand all day again yesterday. and she said a lot of things about her relationship with travis. what did we learn? >> reporter: the defense team is methodically going through just about every relationship she had since high school trying to show her as level headed even when she claims one past boyfriend tried to choke her. and some difficult times growing up in her household. the defense is trying to paint her as someone able to handle it. then they started talking about travis alexander's relationship with jodi trying to show that he was someone controlling. take a listen to this snippet from court.>> mr. alexander motivated you to break up? >> it was about my life and career and direction of my life. it made me step back and take a look at where i stood and where i was going. >> reporter: there was graphic testimony talking about the relationship. the theory is as they move through today she'll start to show him as more controlling and someone who beat her. gregg: her appearance is strikingly different from her earlier life. there she is on the left-hand side. do we have any indication how much longer the defense is going to go on direct examination? the real fireworks will be cross-examination. >> reporter: everybody is waiting for cross-examination. we expect the defense to resttoday. that is the theory. they are very methodical in the way they are laying this out, trying to portray her as being this calm individual. they have three or four major holes in their story. they say that, hey, if you are going to skill somebody, why would you split them from rear to rear, and drag the body around the house. everybody is waiting for that to happen and that could begin midday today. gregg: prosecutors love these types of cross-examinations with a witness. >> reporter: so do court observers. martha: a showdown over spending cuts that are weeks away. the president says he needs more time to come up with a budget.republicans say time is up. kevin mccarthy joins us in america's newsroom. gregg: he has taken a beating in the court of puck opinion but lance armstrong could soon find himself in a real criminal court facing prison time. we'll tell you the new charges he could be facing. [ male announcer ] it's a rule of nature.you don't decide when vegetables reach the peak of perfection. the vegetables do. at green giant, we pk vegetables only when they're perfect. then freeze them fast so they're are as nutritious as fresh. [ green giant ] ho ho ho. ♪ green giantgregg: a new report that cyclist lance armstrong is the target of a federal investigation. it comes just weeks after arm strong admitted to oprah in a televised interview that he did in fact use performance enhancing drugs during his career and he had been lying all along. a former federal prosecutor joins us in the studio. let's put up the entire laundry list. it's pretty scary. drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice for trying to bully and intimidate witnesses into lying. and perjury. under oath in a civil case he lied. >> absolutely. gregg: will the fed prosecutehim? >> you have to look at the history. there was a case in california that was hastily dropped. some of the agents in the case were saying they were surprised and they thought it was a viable prosecution. they recommended an indictment. not appears either another district or main justice in washington is looking into it. i would not be surprised to see some type of case. gregg: isn't this why we tell our client shut up, don't talk to anybody but me. >> always a public relations ... he thinks he will do to great public relations move and legally it's an absolute disaster. first of all he received a settlement for libel from a british tabloid. gregg: martha and i were talking a moment ago, she doesn't thinkhe will go to prison. i would point to marion jones in a track start. she went to prison for lying about drug use. >> if you look at the steroid situation in baseball i think marion jones might be the outlier. but we don't have crystal balls. gregg were barrie bond might have gone to prison if he had not gone to prison on the substantial charges. put up on the screen the potential civil lawsuit. this federal whistleblower case pending accusing him of defrauding the government of $30 million. libel reimbursement case to the sudden daytime. recovery of $12 million in bonuses for the fraudulent tour de france wins.then sponsoring lawsuits to recoup millions paid which nike and others. in the end heould have to fork over almost his entire $100 million fortune? >> yes and no. i don't think there are times when the athletes give back their actual compensation. a baseball player used steroids. they may be subject to legal machinations, but not necessarily salary. the people he defamed by saying how dare you claim i did this. there will be a lot of lawsuits and big time with the sponsor money. but not necessarily -- >> what about the people he bullied? he ruined their lives. and their careers. >> he took such a scorched earth offensive allout thing that by the way he also created tremendous bad will which ithink will come back to get him. gregg: good to see you as always. thanks so much. martha: the boy scouts of america are expected to soon vote on whether they will allow gay scout members for the first time in their history. that decision could come today. here is the group headquarters in irving, texas. why are the boy scouts considering this move now? >> reporter: they have not addressed that. they refused to go on camera leading up to this answering any questions. but there are several theories floating around about that. one of them is primarily financial. keep in mind the boy scouts of america have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in corporate sponsorships because of its anti-gay stance. intel and united parcel service have pulled their funding and there is a decline in membership. the organization claims 2.7youth members and 1 million adult volunteers. the number of young people involved in scouting plunged 20% since 2000. and many simply say it is an outdated discriminatory policy. >> the leading cause of death for gay kids is suicide because they feel deep feelings of rejection from organizations like the boy scouts of america and individuals in our society that reject that. >> reporter: even president obama said gays should have the same access and opportunities as everyone else in society. martha: not everyone is on board with this change, are they, casey? >> reporter: no, they are not. groups like save our scouting and the family research council have had a lot to say about this. the family research council said it does not want role models forchildren to be heterosexual foreigheterosex sexualfornicato. >> they want to change their principles we are definitely going to consider removing our boys from the program. unfortunately because i really love the program. >> reporter: if this ban is lifted it would not require the chartered organizations to allow gay members. it would change the language and national policy and allow scouting units to decide for themselves. we do not know when the decision will come. the boy scouts have not told us. but we are on top of it, martha. martha: it will be interesting when they do make that decision. casey stegall.gregg: the problems that could bankrupt a major city that the super bowl will not erase. martha: the postal service made a major announcement about your mail service that you need to know. [♪]gregg: new dash cam video capturing a horrific accident. take a look at this. that just came out of nowhere. it was reported by a driver in south korea. the people inside the car are all lucky to be alive. no word on what caused the suv too jump over the median. martha: wonder why they had adash cam on the front of that car. it makes you want to be sure your seat belt is buckled. those people are okay. new reaction from house republicans after president obama asked for a short-term budget plan to avoid what the pentagon called devastating defense cuts known as the sequester. the white house is offering a tradeoff including spending cuts and more taxes. eric cantor says that deal will not fly. >> absolutely not. it's just more of the same. we have got a real problem in this country we know. we are spending much more money than we have to the tune of a trillion plus dollars a year and it's got to stop. it doesn't help people for to us keep doing that. martha: good morning,congressman. good to have you with us today. what do you think about that? the president its asking for more time. a lot of people i think at home listen to that and say this will be the second extension we have had on this which was supposed to be a make or break push before the end of the year. >> the whole idea of sequestration was the president's idea. the house passed last year twice a way to find the cuts with protecting the military and the senate and the president ignored it. that does not solve the problem. this president is just coming back to his same answer. to take more money from the taxpayers. that is not the answer. we need to get government under control and expand this economy. martha: the thinking is on the fiscal cliff deal you didn't have that much leverage. this time around you do. charles krauthammer was on special report with bret baier and said they need to donothing. republicans should sit on their hand in this one. are you going to do that? >> we are not doing nothing sitting back because we have passed a bill that would find the cuts to make it go forward. but we are moving forward to produce a budget that balances and grows the economy. where the president for the last five times has missed the deadline. we had to threaten the senate to do a budget. haven't done one in the last four years. and it's sad that the last two weeks we have to spend our time on one of the most basic things to get them to answer. martha: the president said yesterday they have cut 2.5 trillion in defend city reduction. all the thing that were on the table when he tried to make a deal with john boehner are still there. entitlement reform, tax reform is still on the table. come to the white house. try to hammer out a deal based on that framework.why not? >> do you know how many times he's been to the white house and he pulls the football out from under you. this president never comes to an agreement. of all the budgets the president sent to this capital it has not received one vote from a republican or democrat. this president has increased spending and put deficits in the trillion dollars every single year. you can't continue that. the cbo director warned yesterday that the amount of debt to the gdp is in dire straits. we have to do something about it. martha: what many your next move? >> put a budget that reforms government. expand the economy and lets us grow. that's something we passed. this is sequestration the president asked for. it's going through march 1. he requested it. he ignored it. the house has acted.martha: you will allow sequestration to kick in on march 1. >> this is what the president asked for. martha: he says he's willing to do entitlement reform. why would you be reluctant to do means testing or raise the age for those of us under 55 and have a ways to go before we get to that point. why do you think he doesn't want to get together with republicans on that idea that seems to get a lot of general support. >> the president has never campaigned for it and he always fought against it in the time it came forth. that's the challenge when he says come negotiate with us. i think what needs to happen. the house passed a budget. the senate needs to pass a judge the and let many start working from there. show where the path will be where you can make fiscal responsibility here and bring accountability back to washington. martha: you are sayingsequestration would kick in. the senate says they are going to put out a budget. it's been over three years. always good to have you with us today. the majority whip, california congressman, kevin mccarthy. thank you, sir. gregg: some dangerous weather heading toward some of the biggest cities in the northeast. what can we expect from this latest winter blast? we'll have a live update from the fox news extreme weather center.gregg: extreme weather is headed toward the northeast. the area could be hit by a so-called weather blockbuster this weekend. how extreme is this one? >> reporter: a lot of people have been asking for snow across the northeast. we still have time to go so it's only wednesday and we are expecting the storm later in the day friday and early saturday morning. everyone around the northeast just needs to be made aware. there is a storm that could be coming to wrap up the workweek and. the big story will be the wind and the possibility of significant snowfall. especially across eastern portions of new england. this is one of our computer models. this computer model has kept the storm track focused to the coast. so that means a greater chance of heavy snowstorm parts of new england, and strong winds. and this model also keeps a stronger storm system.so this will be critical as to how much snow we'll be seeing and where. the area right now that does seem to have a higher confidence seeing a foot of snow will be massachusetts, vermont, new hampshire and southern areas across the state of main. there is another computer model that keeps the storm weaker. it keeps a rain event across the atlantic. d.c., you could be seeing a wintry mix as we head into friday and early saturday morning as well. and very strong winds with this storm system. a classic nor'easter. southern areas in vermont, new hampshire and maine. we are expecting 6 inches of snow. but the possibility for more snow does exist and we'll continue to see watches and warnings as we head into today and tomorrow as the storm system continues to tomorrow. just a foul snow showers in thenortheast. nothing too significant. the two areas of low pressure that will merge. one is across texas. the other across the make northwest. a possible north easter friday and saturday. gregg: let's hope we don't have any power outages. some people are still suffering. you are passing the white stuff on. martha: i like snow, not power outages. let's talk about the story brewing this week. there were details leaked on president obama's drone strike policy that some say make him the judge, jury and executioner in these cases. it's raising a lot of questions about presidential power and the constitution. is it in line with what he publicly said about the fight against terror and how would people respond if another president had done the same thing? gregg: we are minutes away from a big announcement by the u.s. postal service.that's a live look in washington, d.c. why mail delivery as we know it could be changed forever.

>> if this had been the bushadministration we'd be talking impeachment now. in the bush administration what happened, necessity water boarded three admitted self-indicted criminals who were part of september 11th. that was something that was called great human cry. now we have american citizens being killed. i have no problem with anybody being killed who makes war in my country. we are doing it in an open-ended way. this is the same guy, john brennan was at the c irk a during the waterboarding day, the enhanced interrogation and he's the mastermind of the drone wars and the new cia director. martha: what do you think it tells us about the obama administration's policy towards the war on terror? >> i think a couple of things. they don't want to get their fingers dirty. they don't want american casualties. known wants that. the problem i think is three in the whole drone war idea, number one we may have been very good at the very beginning when we were taking out key people invery difficult to reach parts of pakistan and afghanistan but we've now expanded that drone war and are the third thing martha that worries me probably more than anything we are lowering the threshold of when we use force. it's an important thing to have americans in the loop. by doing something where no americans are at risk. martha: it negates your ability to get intelligence from any of these individuals. >> yeah, they are dead. martha: we know the president is not fond of the gitmo model. it raises a lot of questions about the most useful way toapprehend people and get information from them. as far as we know, right we are talking about anwar al-awlaki, and american-born citizen who we know was an inspiration to the fort hood shooter and the time square bomber and underwear pwo*erpl, most americans would think that was a pretty legitimate case built there and two others connected to them. we are are not talking about any other instances that we know of. >> against american citizens. there are an awful lot against the taliban. we are the only guise with drones now. that will not last forever. what happens when other count there's get drones? do they takeout an american ambassador driving a car in saudi arabia? you could even see drone attacks in the united states. i worry about the precedent, the generation that we're creating of people who are really going to hate america and i worry about loring the bar so we make it much too easy to pull thattrigger and go to war when we don't have anything at risk. martha: we basically had heard that the war on terror was over in many ways, and yet it has been carried on in a way that may perpetuate it if you're right. kt thank you so much for being with us. always great to talk to you. >> thanks. gregg: we are just getting word of a shooting in ben srer denver, colorado now. several people including children have been killed or injured. we just don't know yet. there is a heavy police presence at a home in denver, and witnesses say they saw a child being brought out on a stretch tore a waiting ambulance. now police are saying in a tweet that there are multiple victims but we don't have any further details. as soon as we get them we'll pass them on to you. hate to be a buzz kill but here it is, the city of pwoupl, theravens cannobaltimore, a new report showing that the city is on the path to ruin. they will accumulate $75 million in budget deficits, factor in retiree healthcare cost, struck struck needs th struck. the total shortfall $2 billion. charlie gasparino joins us. charlie there have been 41 bankruptcies by municipalities, a lot of them were mismanagement. in one case it was a huge legal judgment. what happened in baltimore? >> we should point out that they are not bankrupt yet. they phase like a similar dilemma as the united states in a certain respect. in the future there is going --there is a point where you can't borrow any more, your expenditures are much higher than your revenues, and then you are in the muck so to speak, you are in bankruptcy. obviously if they take steps to prevent it over the next couple of years they could prevent that. $2billion is not a huge amount of money. it sounds like a lot of money but think about it, warren buffett is worth $40 billion, they can get their arms around this. here is the problem that baltimore faces and a lo facebook.commess and a lot of big government. they raise taxes at the blink of an eye. they don't deal with the pentagons and health benefits they give workers. the necessary steps that need to be taken aren't taken until it's too late. when you think about what happened with new york city, they had years of that and then you had the 1975 fiscal crisis, and you had to take draconian steps, massive cuts, it was years before the city got back on its feet. they had a technical default atthe time on some of their debt. in some ways new york city is still paying higher interest rates because of that thing in 75. that's what pwoupl has to do. baltimore has to do. do they have the political will to do that? i doubt that. gregg: you have a revenue problem. >> you have the problem of middle class people working out because of lousy schools, and high crime. do what rudy guiliani today and ed koch did, you deal with crime and start restoring confidence in the business sector of the city. new york city is a much let's place now than it was in the 70s and early 80s. the reason why was because rudy guiliani, and ed koch to took the time to deal with the fiscal problems with the city, and remember taxes aren't the answers. when you raise taxes on working class people, middle class people property taxes they run. if you don't deal with crime middle last people leave.businesses don't want to stay. that region of the country, that sort of washington region is the era of the country that is doing very well right now. baltimore should benefit somewhat from that. gregg: when you come in on a train in baltimore it's scary. >> very scary. gregg: enough said g. to see you. martha: karl rove is firing back at some of his critics after claims that he is favoring establishment republicans over tea party candidate. rove says that is not so. he says he is looking nor wins, winning candidates and results. take a look at this from last night. >> some people think the best we can do is todd akin and richard murdoch, they are wrong. we need to to better if we hope to take over the united states senate. we need to get more conservative candidates and win. martha: who better to talk about that but to tucker carlson andalan colmes. gregg: the president said if you like your hilt insurance you can get to keep it. not so fast. details on how wrong he might have been. martha: stunning video of four volcanoes all erupting at the sale time. it looks like the beginning of earth. it's unbelievable. wait until you see all this. we'll be right back.gregg: a deadly scene in fort lauderdale, florida, one person was killed when this truck slammed into a pillar halfway off the overpass. rescue crews working for hours to remove the driver, eventually had to use a crane to pull the truck off the ramp. the accident backing up rush-hour traffic in both directions. martha: interesting conversation going on here, and karl rove is now responding to critics after coming under fire for his newpolitical action committee. several conservatives have claimed that rove is supporting main-stream republicans over tea party candidates but rove came out fighting on this last night with shaun and a tee. he says what he wants is to get the best republicans elected. take a look. >> there is an awful lot of tension between the grassroots and the establishment in the republican party. the grassroots believe the establishment is ideologically corrupt, they don't really mean it, and the establishment things the gas roots is crazy and are putting up mediocre candidates.the bottom line is not whether you're conservative or hreu or liberal. if you can't, for example, attack abortion without appearing into dores rape yo endorse rape. it's not a question of who is conservative and who is liberal it's a question of who is articulate. martha: what karl was saying last night is his group supported tea party candidates, they supported candidates considered conservative candidate, he this is this whole thing about him shoeing the tea party for the establishment is bunk. >> i think he's got a really good point. they did support an awful lot of conservative candidates. the republican party for a bunch of different reasons apparently isn't strong enough to weed out the poor candidates in the primary. groups like karls fills the boyd. somebody has to be a gate keeperkeeping morons away. if you can't speak english you're not going to win election. martha: alan loves when morans runs for office it makes him very happy. >> i want conservatives who can't win. i want conservatives to make comments like god intended if women get raped that the baby should be born. martha: we don't want to hear that one again. >> just to pick up on what tucker said, tucker and i probably agree that carl is saying, he clearly said we want the most conservative candidate who can within, that makes a lot of sense. it's being pragmatic. martha: that is what is known as the william f. buckley rule to root for the conservative who has the best chance of winning and who is the most conservative. where do you think this goes from here, tucker, this conversation? does it get republicans to a better place where they do win more electio elections? because that's clearly what they want. >> there is still a lot to shake out here.no one says it out loud or rarely. an awful lot of conservatives, the republican primary election threat believes they were sold down the river, not in all ways, they are upset about the prescription drug benefit, the lack of fiscal restraint, there is this battle going on mostly behind the scenes between the people basically in charge of the partly and the people who are actually coming out to vote. and i think this will not be settled until there is a broad consensus among republicans on what they stand for. what does it mean to be a republican? what do you believe when you're a republican? martha: it seems like that message, we heard it from tkpo*fz bon mcdonald, from eric cant torques the message alan -- i think in many case democrats have been able to successfully demon mice republicans as being out of touch and not caring about the best outcome for the country on a whole. >> i don't think republicans need any help from democrats to be demon niced.look what happened to mitt romney he had to twist himself into a petition zell to try to appeal to a constituency, try to be something he really wasn't. we never knew what he stood for e. was trying to be whatever he thought the republican party needed to win. martha: which is always a mistake. i honestly believe that both sides really do want the best for the country, they just have very different ways about how you get there. one side believes that the government is the best route to helping people and the other side believes that people on their own sroe hreurgs the best. >> i don't think they always think government is the best way to help people we. have a benign view of government than conservatives. and think government can be a force for good. i wouldn't generally state government is always the answer. martha: final thought and we have to go. >> just to be totally clear, fielding candidates who can make the case, it's not the same as fielding liberal candidates. you can field strong,ideological conservatives and still win. they just have to be able to talk. martha: very low bar. thank you, tucker. tucker carlson, alan colmes, sue he guys next week. gregg: the muslim cleric behind the planned mosque at ground zero is now in a whole bunch of trouble. why he is accused of taking donations and stic sticking them in his own pocket. martha: the results are in the great american board game getting a new token this morning. we'll tell you which one of these little fellas will be in your next monopoly box. ♪ [sing -l [singing] stpho*et. ♪ ♪twins. i didn't see them coming.i have obligations. cute obligations, but obligations. i need to rethink the core of my portfolio. what i really need is sleep. introducing the ishares core, building blocks for the heart of your portfolio. find out why 9 out of 10 large professional investors choose ishares for their etfs. ishares by blackrock. call 1-800-ishares for a prospectus which includes investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. read and consider it carefully before investing. risk includes possible loss of principal.jo a big change come being for the great american board game and it has finally been revealed. i know you've been thinking about this all morning i. was tweeting about it before. monopoly fans voted to lose the iron. remember the iron?

>> reporter: he was the imam behind the ground zero possible being and is accused of absconding with millions of dollars for his own use. he once said the u.s. was, quote, an accessory to 9/11. he allegedly diverted charity donations intended for islamic causes to line his own pocket, that at least according to a lawsuit filed by businessman and tphrapb tr robert leslie deekand his family. they siphoned off donations that were intended for a separate islamic education program. the money went to him and his wife, daisy kahn. she gained notoriety for the mosque around the corner from ground zero. the money went to a luxury sports car. personal real estate. laugh sreulavish trips. they say they are shocked that they have been preyed upon and they accuse him of taking more than $3 million from the maylasian government and allegedly falsifying the tax returns from his nonprofit groups to they say hide the money, gregg. gregg: what do they say. >> reporter: they deny the allegations. paul knight says, quote thelawsuit is merit less and will be vigorously defended in the new york court. it turns out there may be a lot more to this or something else than it people's because h it seems because i and his wife are suing the deeks in washington. that 16-story islamic center has not been built and its future remains uncertain, gregg. gregg: thanks very much. martha: if you like your current health plan the president promised that you would be able to keep it. but a new report shows that 7 million people are finding that is actually just not so. we're going to explain. gregg: check this out, four volcanoes erupting at the very same time, incredible videotape coming up. ♪ [singing] ♪ ♪ [ indistinct shouting ]♪ [ indistinct shouting ] [ male announcer ] time and sales data. split-second stats.

>> well from the corporation standpoint that is supplying these employees with their health insurance it is actually cheaper for them to take the penalty. what happens is the government will impose a penalty on your employer for not offering you insurance. as an employee you then go into the exchange which the government will put together. the big problem i see with this. gregg is the fact that a lot ofsexchanges according to the ceo themselves will not be able to handle this influx of people coming in, so you're going to have a mess on your hands when you have 7 million people looking for health insurance. gregg: when the president was pushing for obamacare and he doesn't mind that -- he's sort of proud of that now. here is what he promised, take a listen. >> if you're one of the more than 250 million americans who already have health insurance you will keep your health insurance. this law will only make it more secure and more affordable. gregg: we now know it's not true, 7 million are going to lose it. was that a promise that really never made sense? >> there is no way he could have made that promise. the way that obamacare is set up, it forces employers not to offer the same type of insurance that they offered in the past. not only that, these exchanges, he knew people were going to go on to these exchanges. and the health insurance offered on the exchanges is not the same as they had in the past.in his mind, yes, maybe in a perfect world that would have happened but realistically it never would have been the case, gregg. gregg: we just learned that the gdp in america is negative, late last week, unemployment went up so it's going in the wrong direction. we know that poverty is rising, income levels are dropping, and unemployment, according to the cbo report that just came out said hey it's going to stay at around 8%, and they call the deficit unsustainable, and yet the president stood there yesterday and, you know, he said we are experiencing a recovery. he claimed the economy is recovering. do the facts belie that. >> no if you look at numbers it just does not add up. you look at some of the things that cbo put out as far as unemployment remaining high. and growth estimates are somewhat laughable thinking that our economy is going to grow upwards of 3.5% in the next fl three years.we had negative growth last quarter. as bad as they look they are based on pretty robust growth numbers. if we don't meet those numbers it gets worse. $1.6trillion it's going to cost us over the next nine years for obamacare. gregg: sure. very quickly i'm almost out of time. the president is now talking about on the heels of tax rate hikes, and tax hikes, more tax revenues. what would that do to the competent? there is a few ways we can get out of this. obviously increase revenues, another one is reduce spending. clearly the president does not want to reduce spending that is not in his vocabulary. the only way to inch sraoes revenuincrease revenue is to increase taxes. if they increase what happens, they lay people o. it hurts an economy that is already in negative territory. gregg: it can have a deterrenton the economy. matt mccall good to tee you. martha: the medicaid expansion part of the healthcare overhaul is causing concern for dozens of states. the federal government is offering funding to states who agree to expand their medicaid coverage. not every state is willing to participate in this plan. william la jeunesse joins us live from los angeles to explain. >> reporter: martha if i gave you a dollar would you give me a dime? of course, you'd be crazy not to, right? many people think a dozen governors are fools for doing just that, turning down millions for the relative price of a penny to pay for medicaid expansion which expands subsidized medical care for families earning up to 130% over the federal poverty guidelines. 32,000 dollars for a family of tpoufrplof for. so, the 15 states that you see here are likely to turn down washington's promise to pay upto 90% of the cost of that expansion, 11 states are undecided and 24 plan to take the money. >> with this move we will secure a federal revenue stream to cover the cost of the uninch churneuninsured who already show up in our doctors office and emergency rooms. >> reporter: governor brewer offers that if she doesn't take the money other states will, meaning her residents would subsidize the medical care of other states poor even though it runs against her philosophical grade. martha: what about the states that are turning the money down? what do they say? >> reporter: they call this a about it and switch. here is the carrot, 100 100% tpupbzing, once you're hooked it's 90%, two years from that it goes lower and lore. a dozen republican governors say we can't afford the 10%.>> people say it's free federal money. that is our tax dollars, your tax dollars and my tax dollars, so don't pull that game on me. secondly it's 90-10. that 10% is the part i'm concerned about as a state. >> reporter: the cost of social programs are typically a shared, federal state funding formula but the percentages do change. special education started out at 40% federal money now it's 20% so it's fears are not unphonedded. it's a controversy in the states because the hospitals are saying this is uncompensated care, we want a piece of the federal action and the states say we want to spend this money on education, maybe not healthcare for the poor. martha: it sound like the burden gets shifted to the state so they have to factor that in in deciding whether they will take the ten cents on your dollar. thank you. we'll see you soon. gregg: awaiting a news conference with republican leader john boehner expected to weigh in on the fight over alooming deficit defense budget cuts, pardon me. can washington reach a deal to stop cuts described as dangerous to our national security. martha: have you watched this case, dramatic new testimony in the trial of a young woman accused of a brutal murder of her x boyfriend. what she is now saying about the very first time they met. >> i thought he was going somewhere, because like he had purpose, so i stepped out of the way, he needed to walk past me, but he stopped right in front of me and stuck his handout and introduced himself.martha: fox news alert. there is a whole loft hacking going on out thereof computer systems. remember the story about the ""wall street journal"" and ""the new york times."" now we are learning and this has been confirmed by fox business network that the federal reserve was also hacked. they are saying they are aware that information was obtained by exploiting a temporaryvulnerability on their website in a vendor product. they say they fixed it quickly and it did not affect any critical operations of the federal reserve system but you have to wonder what people are testing in terms of the vulnerabilities. an interesting story it sounds like they have got it under control. we'll be watching for more on that. the federal reserve. gregg: we are expecting more dramatic testimony today in the ex-girlfriend murder trial jodi arias scheduled to return to the witness stand, continuing to layout the events that led to the brutal murder of her ex-boyfriend, travis alexander. here she is describing how the two got together. >> he was friendlier and friendlier but not inappropriate, but after i learned that he already knew i had a boyfriend and he continued to act that way i thought it would be -- i thought i needed to pull him aside and tell him that i have a boyfriend so that he didn't get the wrongimpression. gregg: lis wiehl is a attorney and knocks news analyst. and monica is w. i want to ask you what is going on here, so much testimony about what she claims to be a life of physical and emotional abuse that she suffered. she is not claiming diminished capacity or in sanity but nevertheless is this to lay the groundwork for a sort of mental defense connected to self-defense? >> absolutely. see we already know that the defense is going to have experts come onto talk about battered women, and the abuse, and what she feels like, or what this caused her to be like, so she needs to lay the groundwork of her life, and her history, and the abuse that she suffered in her life, and why she stayed with someone who was so sexually aggressive, or who abused her. without her laying this groundwork the experts won't be able to testify about why they came to the opinion that we'llprobably hear next week. gregg: liz i bet you the defense is trying to get a jury instruction that is a subjective self-defense jury instruction that is, did the defendant given her history of alleged mental and emotional abuse reasonably believe that her life was in eupl manslaughter danger of death and that's why she acted. if they get that jury instruction, what then? >> the key is you said imminent threat of death. really she has given no indication of that. she's taken the stand and talked about the sexual relationship between them, to many of us it's a very odd relationship. but it was consensual, gregg, all along the way she said it was consensual. she talked about the abuse in her family in the past. i've read a lot of reports and people that i prosecuted and then criminal reports afterwards, everyone has been abused at some level. i have to say the level that she's been talking about is not that high a level, gregg, not to get that instruction. gregg: monica what about theso-called imperfect self-defense, a honest but mistaken belief that your life is in imminent danger because of all of the alleged physical and mental abuse over the years and so forth, you just mistakingly misunderstood the circumstances. >> well, i don't think that is going to go very far in this case, because in arizona she has to show that he is the one that was the abuser to her and that he was threatened -- threatening her with imminent physical force and deadly force. if she can't show that, if she can't show that history with him she will not be able to use that self-defense justification at all. i don't even think just a mistake will even get the instruction in, because she need to give more evidence, and they haven't really put anything out there yet with him. gregg: imperfect self-defense did not work nor eric and lyle menendez so they tried. what we'll see coming up is cross-examination by the prosecution. because she told so manydifferent lies leading up to her surprise testimony of self-defense they are just going to have a field day on cross-x. >> they'll go through every single story she told, to the media, cops, everything. the first story was i wasn't there, i wasn't even at the scene i don't know what you're talking about. they'll have that, blow that up, make sure the jurors see that, take a lot of time to go through that. second-story it was two masked intruders that came in. they'll particular a lot of time going through that story and now she is claiming self-defense. then they'll go through the injuries, gregg, 27 stab wound, slitting the throat and then a firearm through the forehead. gregg: that could go in the defendant's favor because in closing arguments the defense attorney is going to say only a traumatized and abused person would lash out with such extreme violence like that. >> absolutely. and you know it only takes one juror to agree with her, to feel sorry for her to like her, which is one of the reasons why she's going on and on and on about all the details in her life, becauseshe wants to draw that jury in, get a like interest, a like experience, something for a juror to relate to her, so when they get to that part they can say, but we know why she did this. she only need one to agree with her. >> there is no support for the claim she's making about the abuse with this guy. >> i agree. gregg: i think they are trying to save her life from the death penalty. >> that's what is on the table. >> monica lindstrom who was inside the courtroom and we wi lis wiehl thank you both. jon: have you heard about the cbo report suggesting the u.s. is headed for a dangerous place if we do not get our spending under control? this as the president meets with senate democrats. so what is the plan on the debt? we'll get into that. plus, the post office saying goodbye to some mail delivery on saturdays, but do they even have that authority? gregg was just talking about the jo tkeurbgs ariadi ariastrial. the woman accused of stabbing her boyfriend 27 times back on the stand today. we'll update you on what the prosecution wants to know. a new research station in antarctica open for business. we'll give you a peak ""happening now."" martha: we'll see you then 11:00 at the top of the hour. you are about to witness mother nature's furry in a way you have never seen before. look at this. unbelievable video. four volcanoes simultaneously erupting at the same time. guess where this is happening, and how photographers were able to capture this video. we'll show you in a minute. ♪ fire. ♪ fire. ♪ firemartha: this is so cool, mother nature putting on a fiery show like you've never seen before i. know i've never seen this before. a team of photographers capturing an incredible display in eastern russia. four dol volcanoes they found erupting at the same time just over a hundred miles apart. they used a special camera and created an amazing virtual volcano tour. corey powell editor of a magazine joins us. this is not the one that i created in fourth grade. what are we seeing here? >> this is probably the most volcanic area on earth, in siberia. three crust ta crustal plates are crushing together, and where they slide you get a frenzy.there are 150 dormant ones. nobody has seen anything like this. four different volcanoes with four eruptions happening at the same time, unprecedented. martha: it's a great story about the photographers and how they basically stumbled on it. >> i new there were storm chasers, these guys were volcano chases. they were on their way to a photo chute in due by. the dubai. they hired a helicopter pilot and had him take them there where they were walking over hot lava to get these shots. martha: it's almost as if when you look at this you're seeing what that might have looked like. >> this is where the continents came from. this is new earth being born. martha: as you point out the reason that it's happening in this spot, is the tectonic plates, right, merging and nashing against each other. how quickly is that process happening?>> north america and russia, like it or not we are moving closer together. it's about two inches a year, the rate your fingernails grow. that little bit of motion is enough that the rocks scrape together that creates incredible heat and friction and that is the result. it's the same thing that caused the tsunami in japan and what they call the ring of fire, it's volcanic activity all around the ring of the pacific, that's where the earth is kind of living and breathing. martha: that's where we saw that earthquake in the sol louisiana monesalomon islands. >> going there and studying she's things where it's erupting all the time tells ahh lot about how to predict risks in some place like mount rainier in the united states, which is dangerous but we don't know how dangerous, you go there and find out. martha: at the rate your fingernails grow how soon before russia and the united states are kissing cousin neighbors. >> we have thousands of neighbors.we have plenty of time. martha: thanks, corey, always a pleasure. good to have you here. >> wonderful, what an amazing story. martha: it is a great story. gregg: when your boots are smoking it's time to leave. the president's pick for c.i.a. director facing fierce resistance on both sides of the aisle, serious questions hanging over the head of john brennan just 24 hours away from the senate hearing that could decide his professional fate. this is so sick! i can't believe your mom let you take her car out. this is awesome! whoooo! you're crazy. go faster! go faster! go faster! go faster! no! stop...stop... go(mom) i rais my son to bester! careful... hi, sweetie. hi, mom.(mom) but just to be se... i got a subaru. (announcer) love. it's what makes a subaru a subaru. . ...>> here's something you don't see every day. take a look at this, even in california. one ton camel named rudy escaping his enchrous sure going for a run on a nearby highway. drivers tried their best to avoid him, eventually rudy ended up running straight into a minivan. thankfully the driver and rudy were not injured. after more than two hours police were able it get rudy back into his pen. can you imagine driving a highway in california, seen everything. all of sudden you have a camel looming down on you."

O'Reilly Factor : FOXNEWS : August 21, 2013 11:00pm-12:00am EDT",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2013,">> greta: if youon't follow shannon breem on twitter you should start right now. we'll see you again tomorrow, i just put a special question on gretawire for you. good night from washington. and o'reilly is paid for. this. >> bill: the o'reilly factor is on. tonight. >> he is such an amazing person and i'm going to miss him forever. >> bill: another brutal, inexplicable crime, a 22-year-old australian gunned down in oklahoma by three teenagers because they say they were bored. there is much more to this story and we will have a factor investigation. >> we are saddened and disappointed in today's sentence. we continue to believe that brad's intentions were good and that he believed he was acting in the best interest of this country. >> bill: private bradley manning sentenced to 35 years in prison for espionage. wait until you hear the hidden parts of that sentence. >> oh. [ laughter ] >> that's a talented man right there.>> also tonight, a new study says that irresponsible drinking in america costing the country about $225 billion every year. we'll get to the bottom of that. caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. the factor begins right now. >> bill: hi, i'm bill o'reilly, thanks for watching us tonight. another brutal embarrassment for the u.s.a. that's the subject of this evening's talking points memo. 22-year-old australian baseball player christopher lane shot dead in oklahoma last friday for absolutely no reason at all. mr. lane had played for east central university. he was out jogging when three thugs allegedly murdered him. they are 15-year-old james edwards, 16-year-old chancey luna and 17-year-old michael jones. the police chief danny ford says the teenagers were all in trouble before and on the day of the shooting edwards actually had acourt appearance. reaction to the horror is heart breaking. >> he is such an amazing person and i'm going to miss him forever. but i'm really glad that i got the four years with him. >> there wasn't anything he did or could have done. he was an guy jog like he would do. six days a week. it's happened. it's wrong. and we just try and deal with the best we he can. >> and in australia, there is deep anger against america. >> people thinking of going to the u.s.a. on business or tourist trips should think carefully about it given the statistical fact you are 15 times more likely to be shot dead in the u.s.a. than in australia per capita per 1 million people. >> it's those friends ofours in australia, we would say to you this is not duncan, oklahoma, i'm going to do everything can i to ensure that we see these three thugs pay for what they did to christopher lane. >> now, based upon known evidence, james edwards could be the instigator. information about edwards on social media indicates he may be affiliated with the crypts gang that he wanted to be a rapper. that he appeared on a web site posing with a rifle. the father of the teen reacted this way. >> i feel that that he doesn't really matter. that he doesn't understand it at all. he really doesn't understand how serious it is. >> bill: i find that hard to belief but police say edwards was dancing and joking after he was arrested. his sister blames it on the community. >> i would like for people to know in this community that if we would reach out to the youth and do more things with them this stuffcould be prevented. >> bill: other reaction not much the naacp is silent. civil rights industry silent. some liberals blaming america's lack of gun control. fox white house correspondent ed henry got this reaction from president obama's spokesman. >> martin here and in the rose garden why hasn't he spoken out on this in this case? there is a judicial propgd and there was one in the trayvon martin case he spoke out extensively on that one. >> i'm not sure that -- there is some reason in this room i don't think i would agree with you that the president spoke out extensively on it. >> bill: talking points believes there is a destructive culture in this country it is apparent if convicted the three boys are have no regard for human life. yet, he they had plenty regard for the social media for rap, for x box the mother of chance luna says the boy was playing that game shortly of about the murder occurred there will come a point in america when people will see this problem for what it is acultural collapse among some very distinct groups. a violent subculture is in place fueled by derelict parents, a barbaric media and apathy on the part of many politicians. the incredible violence taking place in chicago neighborhoods as well as mindless murets across the country prove this point. until we acknowledge, acknowledge the source of the chaos, we will not be able to solve the problem. and that's the memo. now for the top story reaction kate obenshain and democrat kirsten powers also a fox news analyst. how do you evaluate this story, powers? >> it's obviously a terrible tragedy. i don't quite understand the expectation that the president would be speaking about it or any other groups because, unlike the trayvon martin case, the attackers were immediately arrested. and was just quite different from the trayvon martin case where there was a dead unarmed teenager and nobody had been arrested. i think there was a lot ofconcern there. >> bill: let me answer your question then. i think that the nation wants to hear from their leader, president obama, when inexplicable things happen. so he weighed in on the trayvon martin case. now, if i were the president, why get involved in this oklahoma case? no. i wouldn't. i don't think there is a racial overtone to this. two blacks, one white. they were thugs. unfortunately it happens all the time. however, i think the question is legitimate, you know, if you are going to weigh in on one, kate, you weigh in on the other. what do you say? >> i think the president and jesse jackson and al sharpton and some others jumped at the chance to weigh in when a horror would further their political goals. and that's a horrible thing. it's a horrible reality but the fact that today jesse jackson finally said that this kind of violence should be frowned upon. that was his outrage. but, bill, when it served the president's agenda to sort of stir up racialanimosity, he compares trayvon martin to what his son would look like. well, we actually. >> bill: are you saying that you believe president obama wanted to stir up racial animosity? is that what you are saying? >> i think he absolutely wanted to stir up suspicion on racial boundaries. >> bill: i disagree. i think that sharpton and others wanted to stir up racial animosity. >> the president jumped right in there, bill. >> bill: i think the president jumped right in there because he saw an opportunity to speak to his constituency that supported him to the tune of 94%. i think it was a political move. >> if so then he would be jumping in right now to say we have a serious problem among our young people. that is. >> bill: he doesn't believe we have a serious problem new england our young people. >> we do have a huge problem. this has to do with gang culture and rap. >> bill: now you are absolutely right. but the president of the united states doesn't believe we have a serious problem. >>en on what planet doesthe president not believe we have a problem, bill? seriously? >> bill: let me answer your question. >> you don't agree with his analysis of the problem. >> bill: you just asked me a question, right? >> go ahead and answer it. >> bill: can i answer it? thank you. >> you certainly can. >> bill: here is the evidence. five years in office he has never addressed it one time. the culture, the derelict parenting, he has never made it a centerpiece. we have had healthy gardens. we have had let's do some exercise. we have had a whole bunch of other outreach programs, nothing about this. >>. no the difference is that barack obama has different analysis of the situation that i happen to share that you dismiss which is that our gun culture -- our gun culture is what is behind this. trust me if those kids didn't have a gun that guy would be alive. if they didn't have a gun. >> bill: the gun did it. >> no. if they didn't have a gun he would be alive.>> bill: they're going to have a gun. >> bill: hold it. this is how ridiculous, powers, you sound there are more than 100 million guns on the street of america. all right? because it's historical situation. accept it. there is 100 million. >> historical situation? what does that mean? >> bill: that means when the country was settled. everybody had a gun. >> everybody had to have a machine gun? yeah, i'm sure. >> bill: bill because of the second amendment you can't take them away deal with that. >> gun culture, you deal with that gun culture. it's a different thing than owning a gun. it's making it sexy. making it seem appealing. if these kids didn't have a gun. a knife it would be a completely different thing. >> it's the core thing of the culture. it's unbelievable you feel this way. 95% of people who own guns are law abiding goofed people, okay? it's the corruption of certain groups in this country that's leading to this murder. it's the corruption ofcertain groups -- >> -- what do you mean certain groups? there are plenty of white people who use guns to go in and kill people like children in elementary schools in fact when i think of it it. >> bill: that's insane. just black people have a problem with guns? >> b. bill bill let me give kate the last word, go. >> not a culture a promoted among our young people. imperative we discuss this issue. this will be swend under the grounds when he enthusiastic that. >> white -- what are they doing the violence with if it's not guns? >> let's talk about rap lyrics that promote glorify killing in anyway. talk about drugs. ramping use of guns. >> violence, nobody is doing anything about. >> bill: i have got to stop it it's quite apparent that kirsten and others do not want to talk about who is pulling the trigger of the gun. theyust want to talk about the gun. >> i don't even know what that means.>> bill: i think that's a fallacy, i do. it's the pervasive culture, all right, that is coarsening the country and people who don't have good parents, children who don't have supervision are then being put in a situation where they are gunning down people because they are bored. that's the problem. >> the left doesn't want to talk about it the media doesn't want to talk about it. >> that's not true the left talks about it. >> no they don't. >> bill: army private bradley manning gets 35 years for espionage but he doesn't really. i will explain and dennis miller will have thoughts upcoming. later, what's the deal with these bear attacks. they are on the rise in this month in august. take a look at it and the factor will be right back. ♪reinforced with scratch- resistant glass and a unibody made kevlar strong. okay google now. call my droid. the new droid ultra by motorola. when strength matters, droid does.but you had to leave rightce to now, would you go? world, man: 'oh i can't go tonight' woman: 'i can't.' hero : that's what expedia asked me. host: book the flight but you have to go right now. hero: (laughs) and i just go? this is for real right? this is for real? i always said one day i'd go to china, just never thought it'd be today. anncr: we're giving away a trip every day. download the expedia app and your next trip could be on us. expedia, find yours. >> bill: impact segmenttonight bradley manning 25 years old convicted of espionage sentenced to 35 years in a military prison. the judge army colonel denise lind could have sentenced manning to 90 years but gave him less than half that on paper 35 years sounds big but manning could be a free man in 8 years. if he behaves at leavenworth where he is expected to go. joining us now from washington reaction, democrat james carville. 8 years seems kind of light. and you say? >> yeah, you know, i was -- frankly i was expecting more. i read up on it and the judge seemed like she is pretty professional, she didn't give reasons which under military code she doesn't have to. so i really don't know what went through that my real outrage is how did does a private with a set of complicated life like that this guyhood. how does he get all these secrets that cause enormous embarrassment to the country who did this. >> can i set you straight on that. >> all right. go ahead. >> it all comes back to thehigh tech era in which we live. this guy, just like the other guy snowden, they get in there. they are very savvy. they know where documents are. reports are they are able to asemmable them because they know how to use the technology. there is nobody supervising them apparently. they are storing it here. they are storing it there. it's not difficult to do it. but, a lot of liberal people say that manning, his lawyers today, he didn't mean it he just wanted to expose wrongdoing. you know, the usual lament of intent. and the intent obviously that the government has a responsibility i want to see if you agree with this. it's not that manning is a threat to society now, i mean, the guy is probably a narrow do well, it's just that you have to send a message to everybody in the armed forces and everybody in the nsa and the fbi and the cia and every place else if you steal secrets,and give them to the enemy, in a time of war, because we are in a war on terror, you are going to be punished harshly and i didn't think this punishment was harsh enough. >> again, first of all i agree with you. it was against the law what he did. they don't have a whistle blower exception this national security stuff. if you are a private army an individual citizen you don't get to determine what you think is important information or not. >> bill: right, absolutely. you can certainly have a policy discussion as to whether it's good. have a discussion as to how whistle blower laws apply. he doesn't get that choice to do that. his intention and maybe he thought he was helping -- he was saving the world. well, that really doesn't -- that shouldn't matter. it's the consequence of what he does. and you are right the message it sends to other people. >> bill: he was lucky. a lot of people in america don't quite understand we're still in this war. you know, all you have to do is think back to april in the boston bombing and the poor people who got killed by these two jerks up there in the name of allah. and when you are in thatkind of a situation where at any moment, civilians can be murdered and maimed, i mean, you can't be messing around with national security data. manning should have got 156789 is he 25. i would have gotten -- he serves 15. is he out when he is 40. that would have been fair. you know, carville, here is what amazes me. you are actually sounding level headed. >> i don't quite understand. since you left cnn, you actually sound lucid and you are thinking and you are rationale. what has happened? >> i'm not, no. >> bill: did you read a couple of my books? is that what happened. >> i have never been that way. i have never been that way. you can't -- again, i really don't -- and i just don't buy it. you can block technology. you can stop people from having access to it you can give people security clearances. >> bill: very hard. >> snowden is a guy living with a pole dancer inhonolulu and he gets all of this stuff? >> bill: i don't know if the nsa knew he was doing all of that. when you get tech savvy, i'm not tech savvy. are you tech savvy, carville? both of us -- these gnomes, they know -- they know how to do everything. that's what happens. they have outrun their coverage. last word, carville? >> i do some consulting for a tech company. they have blocked -- they have all kinds of stuff that prohibit people from getting in that kind of thing. >> bill: remember, manning was in iraq, all right?

in central florida. >> we would give up our freedom for freebies. >> pushing people to sign up for food stamps in brooklyn. >> we are a hair away from large scale hunger, starvation across america. >> this is fox news reporting the great food stamp binge, i'm reporting from the u.s. department of agriculture, why the usda? well for historical and political reasons, food stamps fall under the agriculturedepartment domain, in fact, food stamps will cost taxpayers a staggering $78 million in year. indeed, food stamps and other food assistance add up to 70% of the outlay. according to a fox news poll, a majority of voters think that most of the 46 million plus food stamp recipients are taking advantage of the system and are not truly in need. you have heard stories of food stamp, waste, fraud and abuse, well this hour we will also look at the cost to the recipients and to the american character. during this show, you can share your thoughts via twitter. be sure to use #foxnewsreporting. we start in new york city where a proponent of food stamps is working to get more people signed up. >> you are watching a team ofdetermined activists preparing their plan of action. >> the guidelines change a bit. you feel all set and ready to go? >> they will be walki ining aro the streets of brooklyn. the mission. to sign up as many people as they can for food stamps. the new york city coalition against hunger in action. >> people don't know they are eligible. >> joel berg is the executive director. s.n.a.p. stands for the supplemental nutrition assistance program. >> in 2008 the federal government officially dropped the term food stamp, to fight the stigma associated with that term. but most everyone still calls them food stamps. even people at the coalition.>> you are pscened and you woul like -- you are prescened and would like food stamps. >> his team set up shop at the supermarket because people do not want to go to the food stamp office. >> ivan is the store manager. >> we feel it's a positive thing for the community. >> another part of the effort to reduce the stigma of food stamps, was to get rid of the stamps all together. the government benefit is now electr electrically delivered, they work like any debit card. food stamp usage has been on the rise since 2000, but it has exploded under president obama, 28 million were receiving food stamps. now, about 47 million do. one big factor, was obama's stimulus package. in addition to pumping more money in to the program, it madequalify identifying for food stamps easier. the president insists, increased spending on food stamps in the stimulus bill did indeed stimulate the economy. >> and you are eligible. >> joel berg said it saved lives. >> we are just a hair away from large scale hunger, malnutrition and starvation in america. >> believe that? >> no question whatsoever. >> you are just laughing. >> absolutely preposterous, given the fact that only 1 in 20 people in america say they were hungry for a single day in the course of the year starving is silly, isn't it? the realty is that the american poor people are not malnourished and they have too much food. >> robert r eveector is a skcep>> it is distracting our attention from the real issues of how you really help the poor, rather than making them more dependant on government. >> they denied you because of your income change. >> berg said that 80% of the people that turn to his coalition for help are approved. and most thought they were not eligible. >> i will give you my number, we can help you. >> she was not aware that she can still apply just for her daughter. >> you and your volunteers stop and explain food stamps to just about every person on the street. >> yes. >> it could be construed as recruitment. >> we would never, ever try to convince someone that does not want the benefits to get them. >> this is not just an academic question. recruiting people to go on foodstamps, is against the rules. but

turns out back in the great depression, the first food stamps aimed to solve two problems. while poor people in cities were going hungry, farmers were growing a surplus of food. so, the department of agriculture sold stamps that gave half off produce items farmers could not get rid of. that program ended in 1943. among the reasons, is surpluses had disappeared. in the 1960s, the johnson administration launched the current food stamp program as part of its war on poverty. it had nothing to do with farm policy, but there was a political advantage to keeping food stamps under the usda, it made each massive farm billpopular. in a surprise move, however, a move of break away house republicans scutleed the latest farm bill. and they are hoping to draw attention to what they see as wasteful spending that can make the poor too dependant on government. they were not the first to worry about it. it was on the minds of those that launched the war on poverty. >> the days of the dole in our country are numbered. our american answer to poverty is not to make the poor more secure in their poverty, but to reach down and to help them lift themselves. >> it sounded good at the time too. give a hand up, not a hand out. >> at that time, charles murray, was a 21-year-old history major at harvard. a liberal policy walk, coming of age in heady times. >> we were really optimistic inthe 1960s because we never tried to use government programs, turned out to be tough. >> murray would come to understand how tough a few years later after earning a ph.d. in political science at m.i.t., he went to work for a washington think tank with a government contract to evaluate the effectiveness of the great society anti-poverty's program. his ground breaking research transformed him from a liberal to a libertarian and helped transform the natn'ion's welfar policy as well. >> was there a eureka moment during your research? >> there was. i came across a source which had calculated the poverty rate back to world war ii, and the poverty rate had been going down even faster before the war on poverty. and that was the moment i said, oh, it's only after the war on poverty was a few years along that we stopped making progress.>> it slowed. >> it stopped. >> murray's land 1984 book called losing ground, it shows that the program had devastating consequences. >> your findings were controversial. >> very much so. they are conventional wisdom now. they were conventional wisdom by the early 1990s. >> when you can, you should work, welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life. >> by 1996 a republican congress passed and the democratic president signed a welfare reform bill. in the years since, that law has been hailed as the success. helping people get off the welfare rolls and gain self-respect. but murray thinks american is unlearning lessons of the recentpast. >> food stamps is one of the most obvious ways in which the government has reached into american neighborhoods and said, it's okay to be dependent. the cost of that is the kind of pride that used to be the hall mark of america. >> that puts murray directly at odds with joel berg who lamentes that the stigma that surrounds food stamps is making it hard for groups like his to fight mass hunger. >> shouldn't there be a stigma at all? >> no, no more than there is a small business person getting a government grantor loan, or someone riding their private car over a government paved road. >> he and i are on opposite sides of that question. i wish people would understand that if you do not stigmatizeone is he of behaviors you cannot celebrate another. you cannot say of the family that does not accept them and says, we will do it on our own, thank you very much. you cannot celebrate. de stigmatizing food stamps makes that impossible. >> this representative is a four-term democrat from chicago. >> it implies that these poor people are trying hurt the government. most of the people are on the program for less than a area. 1 out of 4 american children now get food stamps. do we really want to take food on you of the mouths of hungry children?

that he is, quote, okay. the same law enforcement official also saying that thesuspect, 65-year-old jimmy lee dykes who had been -- allegedly holding this boy in his backyard bunker all this time, that the suspect in the case is dead. kimberly, all of this began last tuesday afternoon. the boy was riding home on a school bus in this neighborhood, in this area where i am when a gunman boarded the bus, the bus driver positioned himself between the gunman and the children. the gunman opened fire fatally wounding mr. poland and one of the children was taken hostage. that child being that 5-year-old brought to a backyard bunker in the backyard of this suspect jimmy lee dykes, a 65-year-old who neighbors describe as very territorial someone who would become violent if neighbors oreven a dog would venture anywhere close to his property. neighbors saying he harbored very strong anti government views. through out the standoff that ensued authorities kept a long line of communication with the suspect 24-hours a day through a pvc pipe that was providing ventilation from the surface down into under ground bunker. authorities releasing very few details about the discussions. the sheriff only saying a little bit earlier today that mr. dyke had an important story but it was very complicated. the sheriff wouldn't elaborate from there. just within the past hour people here out of the press site where the media are gathered across the street from police command post. many people here heard some sort of a boom. couldn't say whether it was an explosion, gun fire or simply the door on a truck closing buta boom that got everyone's attention, there was movement up the hill behind me and then this law enforcement official saying the initial reports suggest this 5-year-old boy has been released from captivity and that he is quote okay. and the suspect who has been healing him all this time is dead. kimberly, back to you. >> is there any information you can give us about the time frame preceding this loud boom that everybody heard that perhaps there was some different changes in negotiations discussions with the suspect mr. dykes? >> no, there was no indication that there was any change in the discussion. police were telling us what they were telling us each time they came out to brief us that nerp keeping the line of communication through that pvc pipe open 24/7. the sheriff gave us more information that most of the communication had taken placeduring the daylight hours. but no indication that anything had changed or that we were close to a resolution, kimberly. >> jonathan here is dana perino. >> i had a question about the coordination between the local police the fbi and whoever else is involved. that was an amazing level of skill at that local level to be able to do that negotiation to keep that going for 7 days and to bring it to what sounds like a successful conclusion for the boy. >> it is indeed, dana. it has been the presence of virtually every branch of police that you can image being out here. you have the sheriff's office over the jurisdiction. you have neighboring municipalities providing police to the area, then you have alabama state law enforcement officials and then you have the fbi. so you had state, local and federal authorities out here on the scene in what appeared to be a well coordinated effort tobring this resolution, dana. >> can you tell us about what you know about the boy and do you have any indication of what his condition is or where he is right now? >> we don't know where he is right now. but law enforcement source saying that he is quote, okay. in general we were told he was a special needs student, that perhaps he suffered from some form of asperger's syndrome. anecdotally, folks who knew the bus driver saying charlie pullman jr. would keep the special needs children at the front of the bus so he could keep an eye on them. if that's the case, that might explain why this kid was targeted, why the gunman selected him as a hostage. perhaps all of the other children were at the back of the bus. i am told the driver had gotten that back door open before he was shot so the kids in the back of the bus it would have been easier for them to get off andthis kid would have been an easier target sitting at the front of the bus if what residents are telling us is true that the special needs were kept near the driver so he could care for them. >> this is bob beckel. is there any indication this was a single bunker or was there a series of rooms in this complex? >> our reports that we have been getting is it's a single bunker and there were conflicting reports about the dimensions. we heard 6 by 8 feet and then we heard reports it was slightly larger than that perhaps as long as 15 feet long. our understanding it was a relatively small single room bunker. >> jonathan, we keep hearing about this guy dim dykes. according to neighbors it was no surprise. everybody knew what he was doing what he was planning.why was he still out in public? >> neighbors say that it was a ticking time bomb. some neighbors had reported him to the police but they say the problem is, if they were reporting gun fire the police would come out the gun fire would be gone there would be nothing they could get him on. evidenc he was scheduled to stand in court last pens on charges of menacing his neighbors threatening neighbors with a gun. but of course the hostage standoff began the afternoon before that. >> i have a question, are you able to see whether or not in terms of containment of the area what other emergency services perhaps are on scene to give some indication what the explosion might have been is there any kind of hazmat on location or emt? >> it is hard to tell, because they have had ambulances stationed out here through out the ordeal. they have had a fire truck out here through out the ordeal.then they also have state and federal vehicles out here. they really brought vehicles out for every possible contingency. it's not like when the boom came there was a sudden influx of new vehicles to the scene. we really can't tell from the vehicles here exactly what that explosion was. that may be something we have to wait until the news conference before we get confirmation. >> i was curious about his parents. the child's parents. have you been able to talk to them? >> no. we haven't been able to talk to them. law enforcement has been really trying to encourage the media to keep their distance saying it's a very difficult time. we have heard indirectly. talking to a local preacher who is friends with a pastor who has been counseling the family, the parents and the grandparents and says given the circumstances they have actually been holding up quite well, that they have had a lot of faith all alongthat god would see them through this and there would be a peaceful resolution. it appears their prayers have been answered today.   just curious, the gentlemen who told you the boy was quote-unquote okay. give a sense of his mood? where they euphoric? were they happy? set the scene for us. >> yeah, i am actually getting this information from one of our producers, so i have not had direct contact with this law enforcement official. i can only image any one in the law enforcement community is going to be over joyed this little boy is safe. their number one priority all along is ensuring the safety of this little boy. another priority was ensuring the safety of the suspect. ideally they wanted to get them both out safely but their number one priority was ensuring the safety of this 5-year-old little boy and they got that. i can only image everyone in lawenforcement is going to be ue fore rick. >> i think the situation was made more complicated the fact there was an under ground bunker so there was no access into the bunker to try to get teams in. usually they are able to respond to get different snipers to try to terminate the suspect and get the child safely out. here they had the pvc tube. can you talk to us about that? >> absolutely. first of all it's going to be difficult enough getting into an under ground bunker where presumely mrooably there's only access way and assuming it's blocked off. based on neighbors what they said about this guy with his strong anti government views and apparent paranoia you don't know if the area around the bunker is going to be booby trapped. even if they had a team they were confident they could go in take the suspect out and rescue the boy without the boy getting injured, if there are boobytraps you are going to j jeopardize your team, the suspect gets angry and you have ruined everything. they were playing this cautious from the get go. it appears their caution has finally paid off. >> jonathan to bring you up to date the viewers perhaps just joining us this is breaking news development in alabama. jonathan son scene. we are await ago press conference regarding this remarkable ending to this terrible situation, a 7 days where this child was held 5 years old special needs some say suffering from asperger's syndrome was held by the suspect that many said was a menace to the neighborhood and the community. we know right now the suspect is deceased. this was determined after a loud explosion, correct? >> yes. this happened after some sort of explosion that got everyone's attention at the media center. we noticed people moving up thehill. these initial reports of a law enforcement source saying the standoff has been resolved that the suspect is dead and this 5-year-old boy has been released and he is okay. another thing that is interesting to note, earlier you had asked what we heard from the boy's family. when there was a press conference earlier today while the standoff was still ongoing, a reporter asked the sheriff wally olsen, whether the child had been able to speak with his mother. at that point the fbi stepped in and shut down the press conference. interesting to note there there were some apparent sensitivities about what contact the family was able to have with the boy through out this ordeal. once again it appears the standoff is finally over a law enforcement source saying theboy has been released and is apparently okay and the suspect is dead. >> i can speak to that a little bit. at one point there were indications that the suspect -- or there may have been a television in the bunker and they may have been watching some of the news coverage. maybe that's why they were cutting off some of the questions some of the ideas and certainly some of the video that was going on with a lot of law enforcement people walking around mulling around didn't want to make mr. dykes do something out of fear, right? >> absolutely. he had electricity down in the bunker and we are told he had a television. we don't know whether he was watching, whether he was using the tv to entertainment boy or whether he was watching news accounts. certainly every one here every one in law enforcement was very aware everything that was going on in the area surrounding this bunker was potentially viewable on tv. so law enforcement maintained a very wide perimeter.all of the activity that was going on was actual loifr t-- actually over the hill. law enforcement kept me here across the street and on the other side maintained a very wide perimeter so our cameras were not allowed to view what was going on in real time in the area surrounding the bunker. obviously law enforcement authorities were very concerned that mr. dykes might be watching what was unfolding on tv and didn't want to insight any violence. >> from my perspective the law enforcement officials who have been keeping people informed have been very professional and giving as much information as they possibly could to the public that is very interested in the well-being of the little boy. the press conference coming up do you expect they will be able to be more forthcoming with the details we are asking you that you have been trying to get but haven't been able to yet partly out of, sounds like, safety forthe boy. >> caution, yeah, out of an abundance of caution. every time the sheriff came out it was like he was almost apologizing to the media that he couldn't give us more information. seemed like there was stuff at the tip of his tongue that he wanted to share. but out of abundance of caution didn't want to do anything to jeopardize a peaceful resolution of this potentially violent standoff. earlier today he said that he had a discussion with his own family and his mother told him some of the things that people were speculating about out in the community. he said that he assured his mother that he and everyone in law enforcement were doing everything humanly possible to ensure the safety and the safe release of this little boy. the other interesting thing that came out of today's press conference in particular the one that happened earlier today just before the fbi stepped in andshut down the press conference reporter had asked the sheriff whether the boy's family had been able to speak with him during the standoff. that's when the press conference abruptly ended. it will be interesting to see if that actually turns out to be part of the negotiations whether they brought the boy's mother or someone close to the boy and enabled the conversation, perhaps playing at the heart strings of the suspect jimmy lee dykes. we simply don't know. at this point it's pure speculation. i am sure we will get an earful at the press conference that is up coming. >> one possibility there could have been some information i am parted in the conf-- imparted i conversation that would let the child know something was happening or he could move or maybe they didn't want to let the suspect know. >> anything is possible at this point. it would be pure speculation. i think i want to wait until theauthorities can confirm it at the news conference. >> is there any reason -- i assume this press conference is supposed to be at the top of the hour eastern. it is now 16, 17 minutes after the hour. is there any reason to assume something is going on that has held up the press conference? >> it's not uncommon through out this ordeal that the press conferences are scheduled and it occurs perhaps half an hour or even later than it was initially scheduled. i think law enforcement is lining up that you are ducks getting the story straight so they can get into the press conference with coordinated effort and coordinate the facts that they are ready to release at this point. i am not going to read too much into that just to say that there have been a lot of delayed press conferences. this is a very fluid situation that has been constantlyunfolding, and as the initial reports suggest significant positive investments in the standoff. >> a lot of information we are waiting for. is it too soon to hear from the parents who are probably importantly tending to the child they have been separated from. we will hear from the sheriff i image wally olsen and any one else you can confirm? >> wally olsen the sheriff has been handling all of the press conferences to this point. we assume we will hear from him and maybe also hear from fbi because they have a significant presence out here. adds for the family i would guess it is probably too early to hear from them. i am sure the top priority right now is just reunifying them with their son and probably giving them some space to get backtogether to comfort the child and it would be wonderful if in the up coming days there would be some opportunity. we would certainly -- haeshg has been prayi-- america has been pg for the safety of this little boy. it would be great for us to get to meet him and it would be wonderful to hear from his family. >> did you ever get a chance to see the bunker? they never let you get close enough to see it? you said it's behind you. is it so far away that -- >> it is so far away you can't see it from where i am. it is over the hill behind me. so even if we wereo zoom in with our cameras which we have been avoiding because we didn't want to tip off the suspect during this stand off you still wouldn't be able to see it. you would see law enforcement patrolling the area but you wouldn't be able to see the bunker itself. due to the entire standoff law enforcement has been veryserious and very adamant about maintaining a very wide perimeter and not letting any media anywhere near it. >> what was the mood like before and after the development. i image from watching this over the last few days it was pretty grimm, at least as an observer that this was a hopeless situation. what was it like before this happened and how did the mood change after? >> the emotions really ran the gamut here. you could talk to any one in town and each time you would get a different prediction. it looked pretty grimm at first, because here this gunman barges on the bus demanding hostages takes a kid into an under ground bunker and the more we find out about him neighbors saying jimmy lee dykes was paranoid harbored all of these anti government views. he threatened neighbors he threatened with a gun any one who would get near his property. it sounded like this was a veryviolent man. the situation did not lock booe -- look good. the longer this went on with no reports of any violence by all accounts jimmy lee dykes was caring for, this is the term law enforce am used, caring for that little boy as best as possible allowing them to deliver medication, allowing them to deliver toys. this suggested that his hostage was somehow becoming humanized, that he was regarding this little boy as a human being. many of us were thinking okay over time he is going to develop a relationship with this little kid. he is going to stop seeing him as a hostage. he is going to see him as a human being and then i say going to start caring for the outcome of this little boy and be concerned for his safety and be more likely to release him. >> i have a question, jonathan, what did he -- what set him offinitially. when he wanted to take the hostages, was there something that happened before hand that the community has been able to say? what did he want from the bus driver? >> you know, it's not a very good reason for this to happen. he had a court date coming up on wednesday for allegedly threatening neighbors, but it is hard to say. these actions that he allegedly took are so irrational it's hard for us as rational human beings to say oh it's the court date that set him off. neighbors are suggesting that he was a ticking time bomb that he was angry and something was eventually going to set him off. whether that court date was the straw that broke the camel's back we don't know. people who knew him are not surprised. they knew that he was potentially capable of violence. as far as the violence against the bus driver, as far as takinghim hostage from all we have heard there's no relation. he has no relation with this little boy and the only reason that he opened fire on the bus driver aworeding to -- according to witnesses, charles poland, jr., by all accounts a very dedicated bus driver who put the comfort and lives of his children first was trying to prevent the hostage taking, that he refused the suspect's demands, stood between him and the children, that he even got the back door open, that he was trying to get his bus evacuated and he was shot because he was resisting the gunman. from all reports that's the only reason this bus driver was shot. as far as the hostage taking, earlier today the sheriff gave us a glimpse at a possible motive saying that jimmy lee dykes felt that he had an important story, or at least astory that was important to him. so perhaps, and this is no longer the sheriff talking but speculation, perhaps he was looking for hostages so he could get his story out. but of course if these initial reports that the suspect is dead, we may never hear the full story about this. >> jonathan, if these reports are accurate, this is a massively successful operation, hostage negotiation, do we know who was the lead hostage negotiations were? was it the fbi? was it the alabama sheriff's department, was it a special swat team? do we know how that worked out? >> yeah, that we don't know. we had a state, local and federal presence out here. we don't know which law enforcement department was involved or whether as you see at the command post behind me whether it was a coordinated effort where you had multiple people talking to the suspect through out this ordeal.>> yeah, you said medicine and toys were delivered to this child. that indicates that somebody got up to the door of the bunker or at least to the entrance of it in somewhere or another. any indication who that was? how that happened? i think that pipe was not wide enough to put that stuff down. >> yeah, actually they lowered it through a pvc pipe similar to this one 4 inches in diameter. this was a pipe that was preexisting at the scene. it was used as a ventilator providing air from the surface down to the bunker. apparently this is how they were communicating with jimmy lee dykes through out the ordeal speaking through this pvc pipe. obviously not the one i am holding but one like it embedded in the ground and also how they were lowering what they described as comfort items to the wild, presumab -- to the ch. anything that would have to fit 4 inches in diameter.it included medication and coloring books and crayons. yesterday we were told he gave him cheez-its and a hot wheel car. typical 5-year-old boy. >> some of the reports are the suspect jimmy lee dykes asked the bus driver to have two children given to him. he blocked the way and the special needs children was in the front. so unfortunately this little bus was in the front of the bus so opportunity he was able to just take him. >> that's right. people who knew the bus driver say -- he was concerned about all of his kids on the bus. op hot days he would provide them with cold water. on holidays he would give them presents. he would collect lists from them through out the year as to what they liked. on holidays he would give them presents. special needs children he reserved a special place for them at the front of the bus so he made sure that they were cared for.this may be why the little boy was an easy target to be taken hostage. i would luke ike to bring in a t pastor sam. it has plugged into the pulse of this community and has been able to provide a lot of color, a lot of personal color through out the ordeal. obviously some significant developments today. what are you hearing? >> well, we are hearing a lot f from a lot of different sources that this thing is finally over. it has been a long time. 7 days today since this took place. we never thought in the beginning of this that it would last this long. from all indications what we are hearing -- nothing has been confirmed to me but a lot of good sources saying the young man is out and he is going to be okay. >> are you hearing anything about his family his grandparents? >> not at this time. after yesterday as i spoke they were still believing god to bring her son home.all of us haare and have been believing for a great outcome to see this boy returned to his family. i think the day as this turns out we don't always like everything that takes place in a situation like this or there had to be any bloodshed but we are thankful this innocent young boy is fixing to go home where he belongs. >> tell me about the mood of the community. when this initially happens you hear a gunman go on board a school bus, didn't look good but a lot of people remain faithful through out all of this. >> there is is the bible belt. people have great faith in this area. the churches have come together and communities have come together. >> we are going to go to the news conference now. thank you, pastor. >> good afternoon everybody. just wanted to let you know we are going to get started here in about 5 minutes. wanted to introduce the folks who will be giving the briefing this afternoon. steve richardson who is thespecial agent in charge of the fbi mobile's division. along with

initial reports about an explosion heard and hope we have the answers. we go back to jonathan sari who is live at the scene. >> law enforcement authorities getting ready for the news conference. you can see them assembled here. that news conference expect to do begin about 3 minutes from now. what you see behind me is a -- we have state, local and federal law enforcement and we are expecting to hear from all threeat this news conference here giving some more details about exactly what happened in the final moments in that under ground bunker. a hostage standoff that began last tuesday afternoon with a gunman boarding a school bus and demanding hostages. let's listen in. >> good afternoon. i am steve richardson the special agent in charge of the fbi in mobile, alabama. with me today is sheriff wally olson, colonel hue mccall with the alabama bureau of investigation, major kneel tu chief of the alabama bureau of investigation. at approximately 3:12 this afternoon fbi agent safely recovered the child who has been held hostage for nearly a week. within the past 24-hours negotiations deteriorated and mr. dykes was observed holding agun. at this point fbi agents fearing the child was in eminent danger entered the bunker and rescued the child. the child appears physically unharmed and is being treated at a local hospital. the subject is deceased. the resolution in this matter is a direct result of extraordinary collaboration between law enforcement at all levels. the exhausted efforts and dedication of this community's law enforcement is truly exemplary. i want to thank everyone in this community that has supported us through out the past few days. i know there are several questions that need to be answered, and more questions to come. we will have an opportunity to address these later as more details become available. thank you very much. >> at this time i wanted to thank everybody for your continued patience, thecommunity's support. we appreciate everybody in law enforcement pulling together to get this job done. thank you. >> on behalf of the alabama department of safety and this great state of alabama we had all of the resource from the state of alabama here to assist the sheriff in the safe recovery of the child. that's the most important thing we have is safe recovery of the child. thank you. >> again, thank you all. i know there's a lot more details we are interested in. we will have that opportunity very soon. we will alert you when that time comes. thank you. >> what you see now is a conclusion of a brief but informative press conference in bam ma where the 5-year-old boy has been safely rescued from the local department working with the fbi, the alabama bureau of investigations as well in a coordinated effort to secure therelease of this young boy treated presently at the hospital is uninjured but is being observed hopefully with his family as well at this time. take it back to jonathan who is live at the scene. we will discuss some of the details of this press conference. >> law enforcement officials confirming what we have been hearing from our law enforcement source earlier in the day around 3:12 local time there was a big break in the case the little boy was rescued, that 5-year-old boy who was held in that bunker in what would have been going into it it's 7th day. and the suspect is dead. authorities saying the negotiations that were continuing since last tuesday afternoon, late tuesday afternoon were beginning to deteriorate. they didn't offer any details as to what the nature of those negotiations were or whatexactly was said. but they got the impression that the boy was in eminent danger. a weapon was involved. at that point law enforcement entered the bunker and rescued the child and law enforcement confirming that the suspect, 65-year-old jimmy lee dykes is dead. >> jonathan, thank you for those details from this incredible story breaking news developments tonight in that

weapons. special report in washington starts. >> moments ago we heard from law enforcement and aut thoefrities regarding the release of the 5-year-old little boy who has been held captive for 7 days in alabama. let's go to jonathan for thelatest. >> kimberly certainly some significant developments here mid afternoon people at the press site heard some sort of a boom. at the time we couldn't tell whether it was gun fire an explosion or a truck door shutting. it got everybody's attention we started hetding over looking across the street at the police command post. saw a lot of activity heading behind me. the bunker we keep referencing is over the hill behind me. you can't see it from our live location through out this ordeal law enforcement maintaining a wide perimeter because it was assumed this man because he had electricity and television down in his bunker it was entirely possible evidences wathe was wa television and knew what was going on. no one in law enforcement wanted to tip their hand as to what exactly was going on. they tried to negotiate with this man jimmy lee dykes who washolding this 5-year-old hostage coming up on 7 days after a shooting on the little boy's school bus where a gunman boarded the bus demanding os tajs and taking this little boy after shooting his bus driver to death. taking him and holding him in this under ground bunker. discussions were going on through a 4 inch diameter pvc pipes. dykes allowed comfort items such as toys and medications, snacks down to the little boy. but this afternoon something started heading south. we want to show you now a sound bite from a news conference that occurred minutes ago. listen. >> at approximately 3:12 this afternoon fbi agents safely recovered the child who has beenheld hostage for nearly a week. within the past 24-hours negotiations deteriorated and mr. dykes was observed holding a gun. at this point fbi agents fearing the child was in eminent danger entered the bunker and rescued the child. the child appears physically unharmed and is being treated at a local hospital. the subject is deceased. >> so again, the suspect in this case is dead. the bilittle boy apparently oka but being checked out as a precaution at a local hospital. i want to bring in pastor michael fen who has been a frequent guest through out the ordeal and has his hand on the pulse of this community. what can you tell us? what are your thoughts at this point? >> well it's almost like a breath of -- a relief i guess you would say that this thing has finally come to an end.we are not happy there had to be more bloodshed, a loss of anybody's life is a tragic thing. extremely happy and thankful to god thankful to authorities everyone who had a part in bringing this boy safe. important part is bringing him home with his family. >> you don't have direct contact with the boy's family but you are friends of the pastor who does. knowing what you know about the family now that the boy is being reunited what do they need foint? >> right now emotionally they have got to be on the greatest high they have ever been on. i would assume it's like a 4-year-old on christmas morning but a whole lot better to hear the news their child is going to be reunited with them. the next several weeks and months they will need a lot of love and comfort and friendship. when they actually get out of seclusion which they have been they are going to see the whole nation have stood behind them and stood behind to meet them.>> they are reunited with their child. sadly we can't say the same for the family of charles poland, jr., the bus driver who lost his life. by all accounts trying to protect his children from that gunman who came on board. tell me about what you are hearing from the community there really has been an outpouring of sentiment toward the bus driver and his family. >> every where you go around the midland city area you will see signs rest in peace mr. charles poland. we attended his funeral yesterday. it was a wonderful celebration of life rather than talking his death. from everything we understand from people that we know who was good friends with him. he was one of the cream of the crop. a great man that loved god and loved his family and loved those kids on the bus. when a person like this is snatched out af community, sure there's going to be a loss. >> pastor michael senn, thank you very much. glad we can report some good news about this little boy.also, kimberly, i want to tell you we have received a written statement from robert bentley, the governor of alabama. he says, quote, i am thankful that the child who was abducted is now safe. i am so happy that this little boy can now be reunited with his family and friends. we will all continue to pray for the little boy and his family as they recover from the trauma of the last several days. back to you.   jonathan we are going to ask you to stand by. we are going to be back with more after this break. jonathan live until midland city alabama with a sudden development. good ending to this 7 days the little boy has been held captive and has now been released to his family. stay with us. this is so sick!i

would they have used some kind of small tiny camera? >> that's entirely possible. law enforcement as told us nothing about that. they were certainly in communication with him. they were using, for those viewers just joining us now a pvc pipe that was normally usedto provide ventilation for the bunker, it was similar to this pipe, similar dimensions at least in terms of width. they were able to drop comfort supplies to the little boy, red hot wheels car, food, medication. so they had at least indirect physical contact with that bunker. wh whether they used that for some other means to get some sort of monitoring equipment down there. we don't know. it certainly would have been possible. >> jonathan serrie we will be coming back to you in a few moments. the 5-year-old little boy from midland city alabama has been recovered successfully. more on that when we return.>> this is a fox news alert back with breaking news details in the ob dux abduction of 5-year- ethan from midland city, alabama. he has been released recovered successfully by law enforcement. he is in the hospital receiving some physical ascension making sure he is okay and with his family members. the suspect however has not fared so well. the 65-year-old mr. dykes is deceased he was killed or perhaps took his own life. those details have not been forth coming from the general briefing we received moments ago from law enforcement. we do have new developments. a statement from one of theeyewitnesss at the scene that heard the explosion that culminated. here we go mr. byron martin. >> i walked out my back door and heard a big boom. then i heard shots. >> a lot of gun shots? >> there were more than 5 or 6 i am sure. >> could you see? >> no. but i felt the ground shaking. whatever they did to it i felt it. >> we are getting more information about what happened. he was a witness at the scene when this went down. >> just to sum things up a little bit. there's going to be another press conference where they are going to answer the questions we all still have how they rescued the boy how they knew the by was brandishing a gun. james london jr. who was killed was being laid to rest today. also this week ethan, the boy allegedly named ethan was going to turn 6 years old this week. good news and some what sombernews with the bus driver hero. >> i want to compliment all of the law enforcement officials the way they coordinated and kept people informed it really captivated america in this story. i am thankful it resulted in this ending. >> it was nice what they did in terms of honor and respect to the fallen slain bus driver because he was somebody really revered in the community. people had a lot of respect for him. children were like his family. he went out of his way to protect them. he in fact knew the suspect mr. dykes. they had known each other from the neighborhood and the area. he took the bullet to save the life of a little kid. >> thankfully this ended the way it did. i had no idea how this was going to go. i thought it was hopeless. >> what is per sip yent. >> law enforcement prosecutorial term. someone is present at the team is an eyewitness heard information. >> i have to commend you on this. we did an hour show on"

: FOXNEWS : August 25, 2013 11:00pm-12:00am EDT",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2013,">> once people come to d.c., they never leave. >> that's our show, i'm john stossel. thanks for watching. seconds. tonight on huckabee, with the signature legislation broke the president is blaming republicans. >> one unifying principle in the republican party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care. it is not only the gop that doesn't like obama care. >> it is a huge train wreck. >> the a ca is the most complex pose of legislation passed by the united states congress. >> democrats and irs and youns and major issues with obama care. the president said no one has a better plan. >> some say we don't have solutions. i say we do. tonight, the cost and cure.huckabee special. the governor's solutions to obama care. ladies and gentlemen, governor mike huckabee. thank you. thank you very much. we have a great audience here. and let me say welcome to huckabee from the fox news studios in new york city. all right. train wreck, hopelessly complex, will destroy the 40 hour work week and devastate working people. and those are comments made about obama care. those are made by the people who supported it. president obama rejected republican input on the bill and complained every since that the republicans are not in favor of it. i wonder if he looked around to see how many democrats are all jacked up about it. last week, i asked austingoolsby if he could think of a single democrat up for election running on obama care instead of away from it. can you name me any democrats who are running on his or her support for obama care to which they would like to be reelected. i can't think of anybody running with it, but they are running from it. >> that may be a fair point. i am a policy guy and not watching the races. >> i can't find anybody who said that will get me re- elected. just last month the president falsely accused republicans of not having any options of their open. >> at least they used to say we'll replace it with something better. there is not a pretense now. >> you know congressman tom price of georgia was a orth pedic surgeon has a bill that isfull of ideas and the governors in all 50 states. >> i have been in 57 states. i think one left to go. >> well, however many states there are. 50 or 57. governors have had many creative and innovative ways to bring health care to the citizens that doesn't break the bank or require total submission to the government. no doubt about it. i have been brut will in my criticism of what would be better called the not so affordable act. i am not alone. the irs has begged to be exempted and congress and their staffs swupg a sweet little deal to get themselves subsidized to the costs on them. and half of the deadline to the law has been missed and the administration is having to hiretens of thousands of so- called navigator to try to explain the 2300 page monstrosity to people who try to sign up. eastbound though there will not be time to run a background check on the navigator and you might get confidential and financial and medical and social security number to felons and identity thieves. what could go wrong? ten and half years i was governor, i spent as much of my time trying to deliver health care to the citizens as anything. and in most every state, the government runs the largest health insurance pool in the state's health plan and his or her medicaid plan is the largest of the state. and so tonight, buckle up and hang on, it is going to be a show unlike any we have done before. i promise you this.you will hear simple solutions that work. we'll take questions from the studio audience and answering the questions that you have been sending in this week. i am not going to spend my time or yours reciting the problems of obama care. i will give you common sense solutions that could radically transform the health care system. i have to tell you, i really hoped that the president would watch our show tonight. i really did. i is not word that if the president wanted options to his train wreck, we would be presenting them. i got this response from assistant white house press secretary matt foley with the reaction. >> we ladefreaken da. >> okay, so maybe he will not stay through the whole show. but i am pretty sure you will like our solutions a whole lotbetter. i really do. (applause) all right. i am going to talk to our audience and i want you to be here with us. audience, first of all, thank you for coming and we'll have a great time here tonight. and let me begin by saying that we really don't have a health care crisis in america. you hear that all of the time. we have a health care crisis. no, we don't. we have a health crisis. people from all over the world come here for health care, don't they in why? we have good health care system. what we don't have is a nation of healthy people. and the result is the costs are out of control. so what we are going to do tonight, begin to talk about what we need to do to make the positive changes. and by the way, one of the challenges from the obama care from the beginning, it is not a health care reform system. it is an insurance program.that's what it is. it is an insurance program. and i want you to think about that. making people covered. and having them is a depend thing. having car insurance would give you more a gallon. and if you had life insurance you would never do i. having insurance may only give you greater access to the doctor and the real issue is addressing the fact that we are a nation that is pretty sick. 80 percent about 80 percent of the health care costs in the united states is dealing with chronic disease. we live longer and we don't livehealthier. a fact that might shock you. 75 percent of the health care costs will happen in the last two years of life. that figure comes from dr. kepeth cooper the origin eightor of orobbics and probably someone who studied health care and the affects of health care over the longest period of time in america. if you live to be 80, that means up until 78 years old you are only spending 25 percent of the health care dollars from the last two years from 78 to 80. you will spend 75 percent. why? because we don't run to the finish line. we basically are drug to the finish line. and in the dead map and be appear and think weekend inbernies. that is health care. we are all but dead but we continue to spend monnethe last months of our lives and so what i want to do tonight is talk about the reasons that we are in the mess we are in. we are looking at it from the stand point of what is the crisis and costs and how did it happen and then we'll get in to the cure and how did we fix it. the president said there are not ideas and i tell you there are most certainly are. >> let me give you reasons. why do we have such an issue with chronic disease? becomely other than dpenetics that you can't fix is all behaviorial free basic behaviors cause most of the chronic disease. overeating, under exercising and smoking. what we have in this counsel row, we have a culture of disease rather than a culture of health.and by the way, you can so it in all forms of our culture, even depicted in the media. >> i rode a lot of mills for that day and downed a lot of doughnuts. chocolate doughnuts. they taste good and got the sugar to get me going in the morning. that's why they are on my training table since i was a kid. >> there you go. that is the issue. we are a sick nation and all of the insurance in the world will not make us healthier. and that ought to be the goal of the health care reform. we asked you at home to send us questions and concerns about obama care. here's one. >> if only 15 percent of the americans don't have insurance then why is this night mayor forced on the rest of us? >> we'll talk about that and we'll tell you why we need to prioritize prevention. that's when we come back on thisspecial ♪ there's a new way to fight litter box odor. introducing tidy cats with glade tough odor solutions. two trusted names, one amazing product.

>> it is a great question and one of the reasons that people have angst about the whole system. rather than focus on getting deliver of insurance to the uninsured, we ended up completely turning the complete health care system on its head and the result is higher costs and not exactly where we need to go. what is important. why has our system completelycollapsed in ourselves. the reason is because the system is upside down. it is an upside down system. what we ought to be focusing on is prevention of disease. what do we focus on america entervention. we wait until people are catastrophically ill and rushed in the expensive treatment that is designed. and the result is a health care system like we have which delivers extraordinary levels at expensive intervention rather than the less expensive. what our proirts ought to be. if i were making it up this is how it would g. prevenning and secondly you can't prevent cure it. and if you can't cure it, then sure, you treat it. that's the way it ought to go. prevent it and if you can't treat. it we do the opposite. we focus in this country ontreating things and that's where we spend most of our money and spend a little bit trying to cure and spend very little on trying to prevent and we wonder why the costs is so high? part of the reason is, part of something that may not surprise or shock you. because money is in treatment. that's where the money is. you ever heard the statement follow the money. not too many weeksing on, i had stephen breel on the show and talked about the role of money in the health care system. >> we have lived in two economies in this country. economy you and i know. hard pressed and money is tight. and then the health care economy where everybody is doing well except maybe the nurses and the doctors. but the people who sell the equipment and make the drugs and people who run the nonprofithospitals are all making ridiculous amounts of money. ntherein is a lot of our problem. money is made hand overs if in the health care industry. but not going to you, to make you better. but to make certain elements of the health care providers much wealthier. and you know who is not getting a fair share of the health care dollar, your doctor? they are earning far less now than they earned several years ago. can you understand why they are getting out of medicine and nower are getting in when because of obama care? we need more doctors and not fewer ones? why would people get in the health care system? here's what is happening to us. 15 percent of the gross domestic product. gdp means everything in our economy. everything we buy, sell or rent. it is the totality.and the soup to nuts edition of the economy. 17 percent of it goes to health care. it is the highest in the world. most countries may get to nine. under developed countries are 1 and 2. known 63 it was throw percent of the gdp. and we now spend 2.7 trillion a year in terms of the health care system. and so if you want to know what the formula is for how it is getting this way, just think about that it is all about the money. snet snow show me the money. and okay. . you get the picture, right. let me talk a little bit aboutthe health costs in the country. most of us have lived our lives in the culture. i grew up in the south and i grow up in the south and i grew up poor. i told people my own battles with health are largely geographical and economic and religious. if you grew up in the south you group with fried food. anybody here from the south? everything you ate was freewayed. everything. it was a vegetable you fry it and meat you try it and dessert you fry it and fried salad and fried meat and potatoes and finish off with a freewayed pie. you know why you fry food in the south. poverty in the south went hand in hand and you batter it you increase theical row and it was a matter of survival. we fried food that's how we survived. two of the things. what does religion have to do with it? anybody here a baptist?okay, do i have to tell you. when i was in grade school, i will never forget show and tell. religion. a little jewish boybrought a mennora and catholic girl brought a rosary and explained and i was a baptist. i brought a covered dish. it is the only thing i knew. you understand? much of our health is related to our culture. and another part of the reason, we have 90 percent of the health care costs that are third party payment. what is it that mean? the person who pays the bill is not receiving the treatment. if you are the patient and receiving the treatment, you have no idea what your health care costs because you never see it. and when you are not involved in what it is costing and how it gets paid, you really don't care. and guess what, most americans don't care because they don'thave. to insurance company is paying for it and later in the show, i will explain why that is a bad idea and tell you what we can do to fix it. solution we had. 2300 pages, complicated. here's what dr. robert payne said on our show when i asked to explain the complexity of health care. >> let me read a section and help me to make sense of this. here's what it said. medicare hospital patients for discharges in fiscal year 20 len and 12. secretary shallthat so manies like government gop to you. does that make sense? >> i wouldn't make it up. i do want to say this. i used to and don't need to anymore. i have got to try talking about all of us. i say all of and you say i mean some. don't you think and maybe that in itself is something. >> you want to run that by me one more time? >> i can hold it in the mirror and i grow up and i i guess it is. i would say this. and that is the second time i said that in two weeks. >> if dr. pain doesn't understand it neither do we. that's why we need this conversation tonight. neki armstrong commented. my foreis that my elderly mother will be a victim of the death panel and allowed to sufferuntil she is dead. >> why should politicians not make medical decision. stay with us on this special edition of huckabee. how mu protein does your dog food have?

doctors have an incentive not to fix you quickly because if you come back they keep getting paid. what if the doctor got it right on the first time and wouldn't it be better to reimburse him a bonus for having got it right early? doesn't that make sense? . and that's one way to keep the doctor and you, both in business. if you are going to deal with the health of america we have to do a couple of things. we have to put a real focus on what is costing us the most and then we have to fund it.i remember growing up in the 50s. and i remember going to the health clinics and to the public arena where we would stand in line to get our polio shot. i know some in our audience are not old enough to know this. some of you are, and don't you dare act like you are not. and you remember the pollio shots, right. >> before known 55 people were scareed to death of polio. jon assa ulk came up with a vaccine and we got our shots and the country decided it was worth putting a focus on and we funded it. what we do today to look at diseases that cost the most money and think of it as taking a man to the moon. we need an apollo program not to go to the monagain. ol that is not a bad idea. but think of something that mag to youed and concentration likewe did with the manhattan project in world war ii. four diseases that are costing so much of the health care dollars. cancer, heart disease and diabetes, and altimers. and the research needs to be and government should do it. i thought you were a conservative. let me tell you why dpft gets involved. drug companies and other entitties can only invest if they think there is going to be a return. they are not interested in curing or eliminating the disease. they are interested in treatment. money is in treatment not in curing or eliminating it. the government has a vested interest in eliminating because they will be on the hook for medicare and medicaid for the most health care dollars. and instead of spending them for chronic diseases why don't we try to eliminate them.you realize that sdoib in america cost 245 billion in year. alzheimmers 200 billion a year. by the way, it is expected to be almost a trillion dollars by the year 2050. a trillion dollars on one disease. a lzheimmers. what if we decided to eliminate it. it would not only be a magnificent effort, for the country and people and save the pain and hardship. but think about what it does to the economy taking a trillion dollars of expenditure and putting it back in people's well-being. how many of you think it is a better expend tower of money than just continuing to treat the disease and ragger -- rathereliminate. $5 billion bonus for who ever first comes up for a cure for cancer. $5 billion bonus for who ever comes up with a cower for a lzheimmers. wow, that is a lot of money. if we are spending 245 billion on sdieb wont it make sense to bonus somebody 5, 10, 15 or 20 billion to eliminate it. that makes more sense and those are the coined of solution that we need in america and take on what is costing us most of the money in the system. terry robinson had to say this on bock bock. as a consumer, i am concerned that my premiums will increase to the point i can't afford it and my doctor will not take my coverage. health savings account is the slugdz. i will tell you how they work when we come back.this is a special edition of huckabee. ♪ there's a new way to fight litter box odor. introducing tidy cats with glade tough odor solutions. two trusted names, one amazing product.

[splash!]>> terry robinson is concerned her premiums will go up so high she will not be able to afford it. under the current system they will not get lower because 90percent of the health care dollars are paid for by a third party. we need to be modelling the health savings account. hsa. what does that mope? this is how it workings. you get a health insurance policy with a high deductible with $2,500. and good chaps your employer will put the 2500 in your pocket because it is cheaper for him. and so he sets aside 2500 and it is years and the first $2,500 that you have of that year you pay for out of that fund. what if you don't spend it all. you cope it or hold on to it and pay tax or tax free roll over to the next year. 2500 might be 3500. and now you have that. and if you have extraordinary medical expenses above the 2500 that's when your insurance kicks n. you are bonused on the basis of how much you manage thosehealth care costs. imagine if there was transparency in the system which we need and you anyhow what this doctor was going to charge for an elected surgery and anyhow what that hospital would charge for the costs of the surge row and you made the same kind of decision that you make on anything else you purchase. i am not talking about emergency rom. care. i am talking about know replacement surge row. in a health savings account you have a role to pay and it is to your financial well it is to your advantage. and what if doctors didn't have to deal with complicated insurance work and practiced medicine and you want to foil the insurance, it is a simple way to do it.after all. your coverage is personal and portable. and that would make a huge difference. this means medical decisions that are made on your body are a transaction between you and the doctor. it doesn't involve a government bureaucrat. i don't know how you feel about this, but my guess is, there isn't a bureaucrat in washington that cares northerly as much about how you feel, as you do. and your doctor. am i right? (applause) so doctors rather than government ought to be primarily making those decisions and they would if in fact there was a inventive for you. here is some ideas. we practiced this in arkansas. we had a simple questionnairethat asked questions and gay them discounts if they were not smokers and blood pressure in the normal ranges and if their blood sugar was in the normal ranges and we gave them incentive if they were. i don't particularly think that the nanny boyconcept of government is a good one. the government telling you what you eat or can't eat. most americans bow up when someone said we can't do it. by gosh, that's what i will do. what we have to do is change from a culture of disease to a culture of sxhelt those who say we can't change the culture. in my lifetime i have seen culture changes. litter, seat belts and smoking and drunk driving. that's in my lifetime. i want you to understand i will take one of these. seat belts. when i was a kid seat belts werein the car. if you wanted a seat belt it was a after market device. if you went down to a mechanic and say put a seat belt in my car. they say you want what? a strap in your car and tie yourself down? later we saw the crash dummies and realized maybe we would be better off with seat belt and now we all wear seat belts and the law is you have to wear them in all but one. new hampshire, the only state you don't have to wear the seat belt. new hampshire's motto, live fro or die. i will leave it at that. my point is this. transforming the health care system is giving you the power to transform your behaviors because it is in your best interest familiarly and in your best interest in terms was your lifestyle and the quality of your life. give americans those kinds ofincentives. transform the system where you have the power and i think americans, we have proven and that's why the health savings account, transparency in the system, personal ownership, portability all make an immense amount of difference in transforming the health care, delivery system of this country. it is not just about saying no to obamacare. what we are talking about is saying yes to a healthier way of living our lives because a healthier way is a less expensive way. less expensive for us and less expensive for other people. now, was that all that hard? i don't think so. jackie sanders is on medicare, but she is concerned about the future. she says ""i'm worried about my grandchildren and great grandchild receiving quality care.""coming up, my closing thoughts for her and for you. we'll be right back. how mu protein does your dog food have? 18 percent? 20? new purina one true instinct has 30. active dogs crave nutrient-dense food. so we made purina one true instinct. learmore at purinaone.com she was a picky eater. we now i'm her dietitian... ...anlast year, she wasn'tating so well. so i recommended boost complete nutritional drink to help her get the nutrition she was missing. and now she drinks it every day. well, it tastes great!

you for being with us. let not your heart be troubled. the news continues. with will see you back here monday night. >> tonight an eye olympic here reis now an accused killer. world famous athlete known as the blade runner breaking down in tears in court as he is charged with muring his fashion model girlfriend. now you are going to hear from people who knew or know them both. that and hutch more straight ahead. on the record starts right now. >> new images of oscar in court. >> oscar sobbing as he stood with his head down in front of the judge after he was formally charged with the shooting death of his girlfriend inside his mansion. that charge of premedicated murder means prosecutors will argue that he planned to kill his model girlfriend. >> most people are a little sad with their vacations are over. >> have to get back to work,back into the swing of things. >> not these folks. >> it was pitch-dark in the hallways. >> the sewage was really bad. >> anybody that tells you that everything was okay, i don't know what ship they were on but i was on that ship. >> there is breaking news on your worst nightmare. a massive meteor slamming into the earth's atmosphere and fragments of a 10-ton rock exploding, filling the skies with smoke and flames, and it is caught on tape. this happened 900 miles east of moscow in russia. it happened in broad day light, too. the russian scientists now say it entered the earth's atmosphere at, get this, 33,000 miles an hour. at least 20 feet wide, this meteor. it released 10 tons in weight. >> all that coming up but first olympian oscar making his firstcourt appearance in south africa. he's accused of shooting his girlfriend to work. adam wakefield was in the courtroom today. he joins us from johannesburg. tell me, adam, how far away were you from him in court? what did you see? >> i was approximately about five, ten meters. what i could see was a very somber and upset human being, perhaps realizing the real gravity of the situation before him. >> about how long was the court proceeding? what did it cover? >> the court proceeding was approximately 45 minutes. it covered two aspects. the first was the media application for the trial and the legal proceedings to be broadcast. and then the second aspect was the defense team asking for a postponement to tuesday so we could consult with their client. he hasn't technically been charged as of yet. in africa you need a plea to becharged and he has not been charged yet. >> adam, reports said he got very emotional the some point. was that just during one point of the 45 minute proceeding or was it throughout the 45 minutes? >> a couple of points where emotions seemed to overtake him. at the beginning of the proceedings he appeared to be quite collect and the calm, but somber, as i mentioned. but as it proceeded. i believely when mentioned murder, he broke down in tears. he was quite emotional in court today. >> he's a worldwide celebrity. everybody knows his story. but i'm curious, is he as -- i acknowledge he is in south after, is he a hero in south africa. >> yes, he was. a flagbearer at the 2012 olympicgames. he has overcome a lot of obstacles. it is a matter of shock. he's a celebrity as in all the sports and the wide media world. >> how long was he dating or was he seeing his girlfriend? >> he was report he had hi dating her since november but they have known each other for some time and appeared in a couple parties before this. but officially dating in november. >> is any information seeking out to with a the police believe happened inside that home? >> there been media speculation and reports. the police were called to deal with a knows complaint. after that they returned at 3:00 a.m. when the neighbors heard gunshots and then they arrested him. this. >> was she shot lou a door? i heard one report suggest she might have been talked but thedoor and then i heard that was bogus. do you know whether he was set through a door. that is correct, that's the state's report that she was not sure times. the police haven't released that mean details. they want to keep that with the investigation. >> thank you. >> your pleasure. >> prosecutors say it was a premeditated murder and that's what they are charging him. but what does it take to present that evidence in africa? it's different than here. william, nice to see you, can you give me an idea, anover view of what the court system is going to be like for this man? >> hi. great to see you. premedicated murder is really when it says and that is it is being planned.the prosecution in has indicated, it is based primarily on fact they are saying it has been planned. the distinction in south africa with regard to bail is that if it's premedicated or rather if the allegation is that he is premedicated then the accused person just accomplish that he sure released on bail. in other words, it is different when you are dealing with a are the trial. at the trial stage the prosecution muffed prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. at the stage of this proceeding the accused must in fact establish that he should be released on bail >> it sounds to me just from the very, very taking situation that's seeking out that the neighbors heard fighting and alittle bit later there was gunshots not not that we are premedicated. premeditation takes some level of thinking about it, planning: it is different than a fight. does your law track that or is it different? >> absolutely. in fact it's quite difficult for the produce courttors to prove premeditation or planning. i think the normal ten theirio is where you might have a people would have gotten together before hand and gift a situation where they have planned to attack and kill a fellow game again. just to give you an example, in this case one wonders what type of evidence will be produce today in fact try and convince the courts that he actuallyplanned the whole thing. your normal situation would be, as you correctly point out, two people are together, they might have been in an argument and somebody picks up the weapon, the firearm, as in this situation and shoots the other person. again, as far as bail is concerned, it makes a big difference. and as far as a trial is concerned, it also makes a major difference. eventually if someone is convicted of premeditated murder the sentence could be life imprisonment. we don't have the death penalty anymore in south africa. and if he is in fact murder -- one doesn't want to call it murder in the normal, but whereit isn't planned, it can be less. >> do you have cameras in the courtroom for trials? >> not usually. in a normal situation a case is not televised. however, the press have the opportunity to approach the presiding judge and request that a case be televised. a judge can in fact turn that down. in this instance, although the matter is not being heard by a judge but by i think you call it a lower court judge or a magistrate, in south africa there was an application yesterday for the proceedings to be televised. the magistrate turned that down and said that only at the stage of the handing down of the ruling on bail can the judgment be televised. >> william, thank you very much. i assume we will be calling on you throughout this because thiswill take some time. thank you, william. >> thank you. bye. >> and he's seizing the world attention during the london olympic games. he competed in 11 races, setting records and winning medals. american olympian blake reaper came in second to him in one race. he considers him a competitor and also a friend. he joins us. good evening, sir. >> good evening. thank you for having me. >> before we get to the more serious matter, i do want to congratulate you because you will be the first american to compete in the olympics disabled and now being 2016. i tip my hat to you, congratulations. >> thank you so much. it will be a long journey but it started when i saw oscar run on tv for the first time. >> let me talk to you about him. oscar is a huge hero to disabled athletes, is he not? >> yes. he's a huge hero to disabled athletes, not only disabledathletes but anybody in general. anybody and everybody who faces challenges in life can look up to oscar and relate to challenges of his. >> i think you are right. it includes everybody because he captivated everybody's attention and everybody admired him and add meyers him so immensely for all he has achieved. this is very perplexing. we have a dead woman in his home, he's charged with murder d you ever see any indication -- with all the accolades he was receiving, any sign that he is prone to violence. >> never. he actually win out of his way to help me out and mentor me on certain things. we both were born with a congenital birth defects so it's something we can relate to. i've seen him at his high he have points and lowest points and still yet he stayed mumble. he was a little frustrated but nothing to that caliber. >> how many times have you ever spoken to him, sat down and talkto him? >> plenty of times. whether it's on the track, offer the track, in the lunchtime or the hotel. hanging out and talking about all kinds of things. life, and things off the track too. >> have you had a chance to talk to him since he started dating the woman? >> he mentioned her briefly when we were in london in september but we didn't go into much detail about the relationship or anything he was going through. >> how did you hear about the shooting? >> actually i heard it on the news. a friend actually sent me a text message and notified me. when i heard about it i was sick to my stomach because with that being said, i mean, he's done so many great things in this world. i'm afraid people are going to notify on all the bad things, which we do as a society, but it's life. i just hope we won't forget the legacy he started and showing the world that having a disability, that you can accomplish anything. you can accomplish anything in life.with that being said, when he started my goal is to finish his legacy and competing in rio in 2016. >> we look forward to watching you in 2016. i hope you come back and talk to us after you compete in 2016. >> yes. thank you so much. thanks for having me. >> thank you, sir. now the murdered girl fend was a 30-year-old fashion model. a celebrity that airs tomorrow beginning tomorrow in south africa. she was featured in a magazine. editor was a long time friend. he joins us. hagen, i can only iiagine how difficult this is for you. this was a friend of yours who was murdered. >> absolutely. it's a great shock. you know, i -- you know, one has to consider the oscar angle isovershadowed by the lead who lost her live. >> she's a gorgeous woman, a law graduate. she has been a model. she's in a television reality season. even at her age 306 she's accomplished an awful lot -- of 30, she's accomplished an awful lot, as she not? >> absolutely. and you got the impression she was ready to take her career to the next stage. and she worked with, as you said, on magazines. she did some fashion shoots, some bikini modeling and on the cover of a magazine. even shot some calendars. she got a lot of exposure from that. but she wasn't just going to settle for that. she wanted to translate that exposure into more opportunity and move into television and you got e sense she was going totake it to a greater level. unfortunately that's not going to happen now. >> did you speak to her after she started dating oscar or did you know? i suppose it was common knowledge throughout south africa. but did you have any conversation with her about him? >> i did not. it was relatively recent. in fact, the initial press reports again were, you know, questioning whether they were actually going out or dating. these kinds of things. the people started saying, no, we're just friends, we aren't really dating so that's how i first heard about it. and the shooting, in my mind i hadn't quite, you know, made sure oscar and her were a couple. when they said she was hisgirlfriend i didn't put two and two together. but then i thought that's someone i know. >> well, it's a terrible loss when anyone is -- ever dice early or is murdered. i am curious, though, in south africa this tv show that is supposed to start tomorrow in which she appears, is there much discussion about -- i read the tv network wasn't going to pull the series but was your thought about this? >> you can understand the emotional. she's in the news and we have a lot of interests. i've always had good memories of her. that's fine for me. people that don't know her perhaps it will be kind of a tribute, particularly if she gave a good count of it. it might be a way of helpingpeople know her because let's see -- she was great at what she did but she hadn't crossed over or dragged the energy by perhaps she deserved. >> thank you for joining us and i'm sorry about the death of your friend. >> thank you very much. >> we will continue to track the murder investigation, bring you knew information as we get it. and now to another very disturbing matter, this one here at home. a breach of the public trust by a member of congress. former congressman jesse jackson jr. and his wife sandra have been charged in federal court with several felonies. prosecutors say the ones prominent political couple used campaign funds tore lavish, personal expenses. another way to say it, they were cheating and stealing. and both congressman jackson and his wife have agreed to plead guilty to the federal charges. john mccormick joins us. nice to see you.and they were stealing, cheating. and i'm curious, what are they charged with doing specifically? >> they are charged with taking nearly $1 million out of campaign funds and spending spet on personal expenses. very bizarre things, $40,000 on a gold rolex chart, $5,000 in parkas and capes. and he spent money on bruce lee and michael jackson paraphernalia. $5,000 on a michael jackson thing so it's bizarre expenditures on part of a former congressman. >> and there is jackson, how is she brought into this some. >> she is brought in because she misstated how much income they have had. >> called cheating. >> and this whole investigation was started off because of the 2008 case in which the governor of illinois, then governor rob blagojevich was charged with trying to sell away barack obama's cincinnati seat. jesse jackson jr.'s people had made an offer and it started the investigation. >> this is extremelydisappointing. always is when a member of congress does this. here is a young man a lot of us hoped would be a very good example to other americans and now he has squandered and committed a serious offense. we understand he's going to plead guilty. i'm curious in terms of whether he's been hospitalized in the last year. is there any way to know if that's a legitimate hospitalization or was this cover in anticipation of an investigation bearing down on him and this was sort of an excuse? or a panic way out? >> the mayo clinic did report that he was being treated for a form of bipolar depression last summer. whether that's true or not i don't think there's any way to verify it. but he's clearly been disturbed and having some erratic behavior. >> he ran for re-election. he could have pulled out a year ago and saved the voters in his district. does he indicate any reason why he did that? because he knew the investigation was going on. >> not yet. he released a brief statementtonight saying he was sorry for his airers and miss judgments and he didn't go into detail at all. a written statement. >> he's facing jail and so is his wife. any idea hutch time? >> reports in the chicago paper are that it could be significant. he could face up to five years and she could face up to three. what is significant, we don't know. >> that seat he replaced, that was reynolds seat and he went to jail for pornography or some sex-related offense. >> and governor blagojevich is serving ten years, previous governor ryan served six years. who know what jesse jackson jr. has in store. >> thank you. always good to see you. >> thank you. >> get out your wallet, you are about to pay for a fancy golf trip and a fancy ski trip this week, but you won't be able to participate. also panic a powerful meteor exploding in the sky causing hundreds of injuries on theground. and plus donald trump smack in the middle of a family feud. what has him so fired up? you

we are joined by the chief correspondent. i know you don't have the exact numbers but can you give me an overview? are we paying for these things twice? >> yeah, it cost a lot. air force one costs about $180,000 an hour to separate. president obama took the big plane, the 747, to palm beach and land and went straight from chicago. he had given a speech on violence and youth violence and all that stuff in chicago. went there to womb beach and cook a motorcade to a ritzy golf resort where he will be takinglessons. when the president flies a lot of people have to go. he took his deputy and staff security advisor to brief him on national security issues. there is other white house staff. there's obviously secret service. when the president landed at the palm beach airport and went to the floridian, he had to do that in a motorcade. he went in his limousine because he can't take a cab or ordinary car so they fly that car down to florida with a backup car as well. it's a very, very expensive process. >> and the first lady, i guess the thing that caught my attention, you know, we want our presidents to be safe, but the idea that they can't go on a vacation together so the taxpayers pay not so much for the cost. we pay for the cost of the trip to california or a good bit of it. she doesn't have the limousine, i asoup, but she has expensive travel because she is the first lady. and the message as we approach sequestration, as so many americans are having suth a d time, the idea they are on twodifferent vacations and we have members of the senate and house on vacations and sequestration, it's just really nuts. >> she flew to aspen. in the past she has normally flown on an air force version of a 737. it's a pretty big plane but not like the president's 747. she did this actually on the president's day weekend last year. this is something she's done for a while, going by herself or with her children to aspen to ski. she's staying at the home of a friend there. but also taking staff, also has secret service protection and also has a motorcade. >> i don't think most americans -- some americans may not like the idea they have a vacation so soon again but all presidents take vacations. >> they were in hawaii january 6th and it's february now. >> in my wildest dreams it's not the message if i were president i would send the american people in these tough times when i'mtalk about how sequestrations means cuts of lots of jobs. but if i was in the senate and house i wouldn't be taking a vacation and telling everybody we are about to go off some cliff. >> the two most enthusiastic golfers of the past several years have been bill clinton and now barack obama. i think a republican president might be afraid to do something quite so prominent as go down, fly down to florida for the express purpose of having a lesson with tiger woods former teacher. his name is butch harm and he's the most famous instructor in golf so this is a pretty big deal >> i think he could do it anytime. i bet he would probably come teach the president anytime. >> of course. he lives somewhere else. he's coming to the floridian, where he has a facility there to give him a president. he certainly taught tiger woods but the president of the united states is a big deal. >> byron, thank you. >> thank you. >> lucky american people.american people what do you think about the obamas taking separate vacations to the extent the taxpayers pay for the two vacations?

well, i didn't really. see, i figured low testosterone would decrease my sex drive... but when i started losing energy and became moody...that's when i had an honest conversation with my doctor. we discussed all the symptoms... then he gave me some blood tests. showed it was low t. that's it. it was a number -- not just me. [ male announcer ] today, men with low t have androgel 1.62% (testosterone gel). the #1 prescribed topical testosterone replacement therapy, increases testosterone when used daily. women and children should avoid contact with application sites. discontinue androgel and call your doctor if you see unexpected signs of early puberty in a child, or signs in a woman, which may include changes in body hair or a large increase in acne, possibly due to accidental exsure. men with breast cancer or who have or might he prostate cancer, and women who are or may become pregnant or are breastfeeding, should not use androgel. serious side effects include worsening of an enlarged prostate, possible increased risk of prostate cancer, lower sperm count, swelling of ankles, feet, or body, enlarged or painful breasts, problems breathing during sleep, and blood clots in the legs. tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications, especially insulin, corticosteroids, or medicines to decrease blood clotting.so...what do men do when a number's too low? turn it up!

>> i think people are less terrified at this point than genuinely astonished. this is an incredibly rarity tohappen anywhere in the world, but especially in a place like this region which it happened. there is very little going on there. it's far out there in the russia hinter land, about 950 miles east of moscow. it's not something you see anywhere in the world, but especially in far-flung russia. i think people were more astonished to have this kind of sight pop up on their morning commute as they were making their way to clerk. as first they were but once they realized what happened, once they realized that -- i think that all was, for the most part, okay. i think it was -- it was more kind of astonishment. >> what is so interesting is we have so many videos available to us so everybody had a video camera taking care of it. why all the individual row and dash camps? i hear all sorts of stories why that may be. >> this is kind of an interesting somewhat nonconnected trends. the reason russians have so manydashboard camps in their cars is expected to a high degree of police corruption in russia, particularly among the traffic police who patrol the roads. they are very often in a place there and the dash camps are placed on dash boards, on drivers' dash boards in an effort to discourage cops from soliciting bribes, from using any sort of intimidation. this is very much kind of a grass roots effort thing. >> it's used as a method to kind of get their own hold on police corruption or rather control it a little bit more. so what you have is an inadvertent effect, it captured this remarkable phenomena. it's a very fascinating kind ofview of this event. >> well, the good news is that no one was killed. a lot of people were hurt but good news no one was hurt. dan, thank you. >> thank you. >> now to shocking news about pakistan. a country armed with nuclear weapons. are they our friends? we sure send them a lot of money. but here's what army general nominated to lead u.s. command told the armed services committee about the u.s. relationship with pakistan. >> the relationship with pakistan is critical. it is a key country in the region. my goal would be to immediately work to continue to build upon the existing relationship, which is on somewhat of a positive slope right now, positive path. >> really? as a general maybe he hasn't seen the just released galloppoll. it shows 92% of pakistanis disapprove of u.s. leadership. it sounds almost to the point of hate. former u.s. ambassador john bolt enjoins us. i'm curious who that 8% is who might like us. but what is that general thinking? >> maybe it was three% favored our leadership last week. but this is undoubtedly an extraordinary difficult relationship. and i understand why people looking at this kind of polling number would say, would ask why we are giving them so much money. but i would say number one, who believes policy in pakistan anyway? >> okay, so it's only 80% who hate us. >> because it doesn't matter what the top leadership is going to do based on the public opinion. they will do it based on what they think our interests are and honestly that's what we have to do too. leave pakistan out of the equation. let's assume we had a country that despised us and we despisedthem but we thought it was in our interest to get them to do something. would we use foreign assistance to get them to do it? absolutely. >> i don't have a problem trying to buy friends. we provided millions to them client for an effort for humanitarian they got upset because we wanted to know how they were spending it because we didn't want them spending it on terrorist camps. but then we sneak in and get osama bin laden and they were angry about that. he arrest the doctor that helped us, and we haven't helped that guy out. their government is teetering on the boarder of falling over and they got nuclear weapons. >> look, civilian government in pakistan since independence from great britain, partition from india in the late 40s, unreached. the military is sometimes called the steal skeleton in pakistan because it is what holds the country together. you could go on and on with corruption, with misuse offunds, not paying income tax because we are subsidizing their budget and there are lots of things we should do differently. but let's be clear, there's one key element here and that is their nuclear weapons. the weapons are in weak hands now. there's no doubt about it. if there were a pair of safe hands to put them in, i would be happy to do it. but the choice is the weak hands we have or international terrorists who want to kill us. >> that's fine. i understand we need them secure and how terrifying it is. but if 92% hate us and they are having an election soon but they are teetering and the military is mad because we sneaked in and got bin laden, i don't know what he's -- >> he's trying to get confirmed. that's what it is about. you have to look at it cold bloodedly through the prism of what is in america's best interest. what is in our best interest? fighting day-by-day to make sure the nuclear weapons don't getinto the hands of religious finish nationallics. >> that is a improved since the president has been there and his strategy? >> we can see to gallop's own polling that it's gone down substantially. >> what about that doctor that's in custody? >> it's outrageous what they are doing to it. >> and we are doing nothing? >> it's outrageous. >> we have no muscle we cannot get him. >> it's outrageous with a we are not doing. that should be a test for secretary kerry now that he's at the state department. >> and it doesn't show a positive slope. >> to say the least. >> always nice talking to. >> that of. >> thank you. >> coming up, new clues of the fashion mogul's plane. what just washed ashore. will it lead to answers in that's next. and dr. ben carson taking heat of criticizing obamacare in front of president obama. tonight he takes on his own critics. you will hear what dr. carson has to say a few minutes away.[ male announcer ] now is the perfect time to buy an adjustable versionof the most highly recommended bed in america, the tempur-pedic ergo system. treat yourself to the ultimate sleep experience and save up to $400 during the tempur ergo savings event. plus, visit tempurpedic.com for full details on our 0% apr financing with up to five years to pay. don't wait. five years special financing ends february 18th, and the tempur ergo savings event ends february 24th. visit tempurpedic.com now. tempur-pedic -- the most highly recommended bed in america.>> doctor ben carson causing a big buzz after the national prayer breakfast. in fact he got more media attention than president obama. as we showed you the john hopkins neurosurgeon blasted obamacare right in front of president obama. some call it inappropriate. here is how he responded on ""hannity"" tonight. >> some people say you can't say something like that in front of the president. when did this become a monarchy?

News Headquarters : FOXNEWS : May 19, 2013 4:00pm-6:00pm EDT",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2013,">>.   stylistic change, you take out all references to previous terror threats to benghazi? >> your initial calculation, was a mischaracterization of what the white house was involved. >> this a separate issue. why not just say this instead of having the background it's such a issue. >> what did the white house playnot just then but in direct changes. >> jon: not a good week to be jay carney but he did tell cnn piers morgan he has enjoyed the intensity of dealing with reporters' questions. back to a guy who has dealt with many reporters' questions in the past. rick, what are the questions that the media should be asking on this? are they doing enough? >> they don't understand the process. you i literally been in united states of email chain conversations about talking points. here is the number one rule. most of the intelligence officers who are chiming in, they usually only talk about facts. they don't talk about spin and rarely comment, but if they don't sign off on the final talking points. then you have a disagreement. here you have a disagreement because you would not take this whole issue to a deputy committee meetings at the white house if all the agenciesagreed. the agencies didn't agree so they had to take it to the deputies' meeting. i think the reporters need to find out who signed off and when they signed off and what was said on the conference calls which generally happen regularly almost every day. >> jon: then you have the president saying, there is no there there. is that spin working. some in the liberal press are saying it. >> it's not working in part they don't know how to talk about this stuff because of their relative lack of engagement in the press. if a fits water or press leadership that knew how to manage problems like this, i think it would go a way long way of solving the message part of this. >> ellen ratner said it was dysfunction al family. four jay carneys, but if there were no there there, i was toldby blank, actually blank would be interesting to find out who that was. >> big question is, is jay carney lying? is he manipulating the truth? or is he simply repeating what he has been told by high administration officials? i think that is key. if he is spinning on his own he ought to be out of there. if she repeating the lies, he ought to be out of there anyway. >> i was amazed what he handled what must have been a terrible awful week for anyone. i don't know. i'm not feeling sorry for him. however, he did say he appreciated the question more than a hundred times in one press briefing. the question about benghazi remain the same with or without those emails. went to the president know, what did hillary know, who signed offon the standdown order. >> holder don't know anything. president don't know anything. this reminds me of white water. remember when hillary clinton was brought up, i don't know, i can't recall. i don't remember. i wasn't there. she wasn't there for anything. nobody knows anything. >> judy raised most important question what happened in libya. that is much more important than the nuance of redacted emails. >> i made the point that every administration has a disdainful relation with the press but you had thoughts on this? >> this is one the worst on memory. it's harder to cover the washington bureaucracy than any administration in decades. they are press minders follow you around whether the treasury department or the epa. they don't give people access to the bureaucracy in any meaningful way. as a reporter i know how important that is and everyreporter complains about this. >> jon: let's take a look how one of the best known reporters. here is what dan rather had to say on msnbc. >> the republicans must be slapping high fives behind closed doors. they have three things. number one, their number one agenda item is to stop president obama from accomplishing anything in the second term. this aids that, number two, they have the next congressional election which is 2014 and many republicans in congress, now they have solidarity with the tea party moving toward the election and by the way, with the benghazi thing, they can manage to damage hillary clinton's chances of getting the presidency but also getting the nomination. >> jon: it sounds like according to mr. rather it's all political? >> yeah, i'm thinking we should go back 30 years through his career and how he spun so manystories from the past. he views everything through politics. it's no wonder that we have a new system of media. i think that these people that pretend to be up by yased journalists have been defrocked. they are just as biased as everybody else. to put it in a political perspective, dan rather, he is not a journalist, he has been an advocate for 30 years. >> the thing that transcends journalism is four dead americans in libya. second, pat pointed on the it out for breitbart news, the christian egyptian american who went to jail basically for doing that mohammad video and obama administration was happy to say this is cause of this six days after the guy testified on capitol hill. president went to the u.n., mohammad video, the guy is still in jail and what is dan rathersaying about him. >> and bunch of deputies raided his house in the middle of night. >> say what you want about rather, people reading emails, all the things are out. this stuff can't stay bottled up too long. that is good news where we are as a media society. >> here is the real problem. if you listen to the dan's comments, same old story, who is up or down, not finding solutions to problem problems. not repairing anything. it's about the horse race and this is the primary thing that turns people off, mainly the media and government. >> jon: good point. next, the verdict comes in and so did the media. >> the media finally show up to the gosnell murder trial. did it matter? and the main man at cbs news admits to failures. details next on news watch. his .we don't let frequent heartburn come between us and what we love. so if you're one of them people who gets

[ baby fussing ] ♪>>.   these have been a bad few months for journalism. we're getting the big stories wrong over and over again. in a world where everyone is a publisher no one is an editor. that is the danger that we face today. we have entered a time when a writer's first idea is his best idea, first thing a reporter hears is the first thing she reports. we've lived in a time where we have seen major televisionnetworks take video off of youtube and broadcast to millions of americans without verifying whether the video had been fabricated or not. twitter, facebook and readit, that is not journalism, that is gossip. journalism was invented as an antidote to gossip. >> jon: that is scott pelley receiving the award and given the state of journalism today. what do you think about that? among them the media is getting the big stories wrong? >> he goes on to really blame technology. let's face it. scott's view of journalism is why the news rooms across america are filled with out of touch elite. this is an unbelievable view. twitter has made journalism better. yes, there are mistakes, butbecause now we all can be journalists and check journalists, we get more and better information. this guy is just complaining because the system he was a part of is collapsing, his house of cards is collapsing. we all know journalism is not what it used to be. >> you teach journalism students what do you say? >> technology is an opportunity, but not the problem. the point is right. twitter and facebook are distribution systems, they are not reporting systems, per se, and the more you ui nuanced coverage get in people's hands the better people off. his obliviousness, we are teaching students to be able to communicate and do reporting. >> they are opportunities and there are opportunities in technology that destroy the traditional business of going out and paying people to do hardwork that takes time to do. it's everybody's a journalist nobody will be paid a lot of money to do the hard stuff. >> i love twitter and new technology, i will stick up for pelley on being accurate and give him to credit on the newtown shootings but still it is valuable to be accurate whether twitter or tv that is important. >> jon: we go back to what we have said group think, if everybody thinks alike. everybody has the same world view, as rick said not count ago story as an editorial decision, you will have certain outcomes. i asked leslie stahl that assured me there were conservatives in the newsroom, she couldn't name one. >> jon: thanks to our panel. i'm john scott. see you next week.that is pretty scary. an extreme weather alert. central plains and midwest keeping an eye on the sky. that big one this afternoon, threatening to pummel the region with more tornadoes like this one spotted in kansas yesterday. i'm gregg jarrett. >> can you imagine that coming straight toward you?

this after the treasury department, inspector general revealed in hearings this week that the administration was informed during the heat of the 2012 presidential campaign. the administration insisting, though, that the president himself knew nothing about it. that is doing little to dispel the shadow of scandal. peter? >> reporter: gregg, now the white house is saying those irs guidelines that unfairlytargeted conservative groups were not put in place for political reasons. sunday advisor said this morning when it comes to the outrageous behavior of the irs, the law is irrelevant. >> whether it's legal or illegal is not important to the fact the conduct, department of justice said they are looking into the legality of this. president is not going waited for that. we have to make sure it doesn't happen again. >> reporter: he took on to his official twitter account, before folks get too far ahead of himself, of course, the law matters, irs misconduct is wrong. president obama in saying that nobody at the white house knew about the prejudiced policies while it was being implemented. but republican lawmakers are still promising to aggressively search for the accountable parties that the irs or the administration. >> we're going to continueinvestigate and get to the bottom of this. who knew, why did they do this, how high up in government did it go -- people have no trust that the government is being impartial. this abuse of power to the nth agree degree. >> and lois lerner is going to face lawmakers on capitol hill during a hearing about the scandal and first time that lawmakers have had a chance to question her since the story broke. >> gregg: maybe she will do better than steve miller but that a pretty low bar. thanks very much peter doocy. >> heather: new reaction to the other scandal, the fallout from the attack on our consulate in benghazi, libya. the verbal sparks flying on the political talk shows with both the white house and critics talking past each other. >> there has been an independent review of this.congress has had hearings. we provided 250,000 pages of documents. there has been 11 hearings. every one has found the same thing, it's a tragedy. question is what are we going to do to move forward to ensure it doesn't happen again. >> what we now know from congressional testimony is that the number two man, the deputy chief informed his superiors including the secretary of state that this was a terrorist attack. they know there was no protest involved. to suggest afterwards this was the result of a spontaneous protest, we know is not the case. so, the burden of proof here is on the administration's side. >> heather: deadly assault killed four americans including u.s. ambassador chris stevens. president obama trying to move forward with a speech on thursday laying out his counter-terrorism policies. but is it fetus able with so many questions hovering over benghazi.judy miller joins us straight ahead. >> gregg: well, somebody is a big rich winner. down right filthy rich. one person winning the $590 million powerball lottery. it was sold in the state of florida. arthel nevil joins us live in new york, my condolences. >> arthel: you know i didn't buy a ticket. the odds of winning, gregg, was put at 1 in 175 million. if disney world is most magical place on earth, then zephyr hills florida has most lucky place on earth. >> this is powerball. tonight we have the biggest jackpot in powerball history, an estimated $595 million. let's play powerball. 22, after that we got the number 10-we are going to meet mike conrad, matched all five whitenumbers. next number up lucky 13 then 14 and than had we have the number 52. for tonight's winning number. match this number, tonight it is 11. >> arthel: there you heard all the winning numbers right there. and saturday evening announcement made a trip to the grocery store far more than a mun day crews down the produce aisle. >> wow, i can't believe it. that is shocking. >> believe it the jackpot produced $590.5 million pay day for some lucky person or persons. the chance to win was a long shot but the odds didn't deter people across the country from trying their luck. winning ticketed was sold at that publix supermarket. no one has come forward yet but winner will have to present it a lottery headquarters intallahassee. the takeaway is $282,675,000. after all uncle sam has to get his money. the publix grocery store will get $85,000. florida has had more powerball winners than any other state. six winners after saturday night's drawing. >> gregg: maybe you lost a ticket. >> you didn't buy a ticket. >> my wife did. that was half my money. >> heather: obama administration trying to distance itself from one of the worst weeks in office. new claims today it knew nothing about the irs scandal until the media reported it last week but critics not letting it off the hook. we'll take a look at the fallout.

>> he was in constant touch with the national security team and kept up with the situations. >>chris: in the situation room? >> he was there throughout the day. >>chris: do you not know? >> that is irrelevant. >> karl rove saying what is lacking here is credibility. >> his words, through his agents, say this is the responsibility of an antimuslim video which provoked a spontaneous reaction in front of the consulate in beach gaza so credibility matters. that is now starting to be reflected in the polls. >>heather: the chairman of the house of representatives oversight committee seeking more transparency has issued a subpoena to ambassador pickerring the co-chair of the independent review board and he wants him to appear on capitol hill this week. >>heather: thank you, elizabeth, from washington, dc. coming up political insiders will discuss these scandals andtheir political impact so stay tuned for that. >>gregg: we have word that a united states embassy accused of spying has left russia five days after being order to leave. according to a television network, loyal to the kremlin, he flew out of the now accompanied by other united states embassy workers as he wheeled the suitcase into the airport. he was accused of trying to recruit a russian officer to the c.i.a. >>heather: another major development overseas to tell you about as nuclear armed north korea launches a missile for the second straight day. the short range missile reportedly falling into the sea off japan's west coast. yesterday, north korea fired three similar weapons into the same area. the latest developments come after near daily threats by the north against south korea and the united states early thisyear. >>gregg: i will take some eggs, and milks and $590 million. a single winning ticket for the jackpot was sold in florida, a grocery store but the mystery, who is holding the golden ticket we have more from the store in florida. tell us about this. what do you know?

>> smart shopping. say you go to buy a car you want to kick the tires, check the data on miles per gallon and resale. say you spend $20,000 on a car you spend more than $100,000 on your child's college education and you do not have the data necessary to make that kind of decision, to know or do a cost-benefit analysis. it is high time we start to consider the value is an important part of a college education. >>heather: this comes after some reports that say college is not worth it, former secretary of education well bennett has a book out and suggests only 150 of america's 3,500 college areactually worth the cost to begin with on the heels of two million graduates expected in 9 spring. >> we see a consulting study that says one in three college graduates say they would didn't get the information they needed we from college to get a good job. essentially, if you are going to borrow tens of thousands, it is presumed you would make the money in your job after college to pay that back. this is a really important issue. of the 2011 graduates only half of them are employed or many of them are radically underemployed. >>heather: you spoke with some graduates. >> i was honored yesterday to be at the graduation of one of my favorite young people, if we can call up the picture, his is john hayes who graduated yesterday,john hayes, very promising college graduate, and i am sure he will do wonderfulfully. binghampton university is one of the top value colleges in the nation and he and his father considered that as they decided which college to go to. they looked at, for example, starting salaries of graduates. you want to know graduation rates, how were you will be paying in terms of federal student loans. forbes and a number of rateers have looked at binghampton and said you will pay a lot less going to a very good school there. that is what parents of college students students have to consider. >>heather: colleges and universities have the information but they have not been releasing it. >> some say, privacy is an issue, you do not want to have this ""sensitive"" information going out but the truth is you will not show joe smith's g.p.a.you just want to know the starting salaries. some colleges are more expensive but they have lower rates of people borrowing, the student loans. you want to compare apples and apples. >>heather: and expenses do not always mean better. should universities ultimately be held liable or punished in a way when it comes to things they cannot control, the job market or the student themselves? it is up to them to get the job. >> that is a red herring. if you say they cannot be held accountable for the economy, the economy cuts across all colleges. college a and college b both face the same economy. you want to know, what are the graduation rates? what are the employment rates in that is a bit of a red herring. i don't think there is any reason not to publish thesestatistics. congratulations. you can catch ""bulls and bears"" each saturday morning at 10:00 a.m. eastern right here on the fox news channel. >>gregg: maybe my daughter should skip college, get a job and start paying me rent. brenda charges her daughter taxes. >> they will get that back. don't tell them that. that will help them pay for college... >>gregg: our political insiders are in the house and they are next. >>heather: we are watching a developing weather system.

>>heather: we have someone on the phone from wichita where wehave confirmation, but still waiting for confirmation in oklahoma city, as to whether that funnel cloud did, in fact, town ground. as we wait on that and we let janice check it out we will speak with the director of wichita county, emergency management. we have confirmed a large and extremely dangerous tornado touched down near wichita, near the airport there in kansas. randy, can you tell us about damage on the ground? we heard there are initial reports that there has been damage there. have you seen anything? >>reporter: yes, we have had reports of some initial damage. fortunately, given the large nature of the tornado, the initial damage reports seem to be relatively light and even more fortunately, no reports of fatalities or injuries. the reports have been rain wrapped this afternoon and that is an unusual feature fortornadoes in the high plain so the visibility has not been as high. we have activated our outdoor wanting devices at least three times in the county and the city of wichita this afternoon. people are paying attention. that is why we are not seeing the injury reports at this time. >>heather: randy, just to reiterate what we are looking at on the screen is from oklahoma city. you, in fact, are reporting for us from wichita, where you are the director of emergency management. repeat for us, we heard there were, in fact, some reports of people trapped or hurt but you say that is not the case at least as far as you know. >>reporter: we have hat no reports of victims trapped or injuries in the wichita area at this time. we have had some minor reports of damage to property which as i said earlier is surprising in a very fortunate way given thelarge size of the tornado that was indicated by our spotters and by radar. >>heather: how large was it indicated by the spotters? >>reporter: because it is rain wrapped it is difficult to give an exact size but the radar indicated that it was a substantial area of circulation, perhaps a quarter of a mile and as i say, we have not had time to determine how long, exactly, it was on the ground but it does appear to have dissipated at this point although we remain under two active tornado warnings at this time, as well as two severe thunderstorm warnings. >>heather: this area is tornado alley and you are used to storms like this. the area specifically where this tornado touched down, could you describe it to me? a residential area? a business area? >>reporter: it is a fringe area at the western side of thetown and there is residential area surrounding it, however, there quit a bit of open area being in the area in the neighborhood, rather, of the airport. so that is another reason why we do not have the large numbers of reports of damage because although this is a fairly high population density area the particular area that it struck is probably one of our lower concentrations. >>heather: why are rain wrapped tornadoes encourage in your area in >>reporter: the types of super cells that produce the tornadoes here are usually the lp or low precipitation-type tornado. that type of super cell, so tornadoes are usually easy to see because the rain-free base allows for excellenceobservation of the tornado. tonight is an exception and we have had rain-wrapped, precipitation-wrapped tornado. >>heather: again, to you at home, this is a live picture from oklahoma city as we continue to monitor the situation there. let's check back with janice dean, as well, we still have randy on the phone. looking at oklahoma city have you confirmed if this funnel actually touched down? it looks like things are picking up. >> absolutely. you can see one on the right-hand side of the screen coming down and the rotation has to be in contact with the ground. that's what we classify a tornado when you see the touching down on the ground. we now have confirmation of a tornado touching down in edmund,oak oh, but whether it was that spector made coming from that cloud is yet-to-be-determined. it is a volatile situation. again, excellence questions for the manager out in wichita, where we do have confirmed a very large tornado that went through wichita. of course, we will have to have an assessment by the national weather service and see what kind of tornado they were dealing with and the damage. we are praying that people heed the warnings and one good thing here is that we were warned, we did know this was going to happen in this vulnerable spot for tornadoes. it is called tornado alley for a reason. april and may and june is when we usually see the tornadoes. on the maps you can see where we have the tornadoes, not only oklahoma but kansas and towardomaha and minneapolis, even. a volatile situation that will continue throughout the evening. this is a tornado warning storm south of wichita. the pinks on the radar is an indication of heavy rain or hail. this is obviously going to be a situation that will evolve throughout the afternoon. usually we see the warnings from 15 to 20 minutes and oklahoma, edmund, is where we saw the pictures early and this storm now is moving eastward. that will continue we think to produce the potential for tornado activity. there is oklahoma city. all of the areas are very ripe for tornado. looking at yellows, they are severe thunderstorm warnings and it looks like the tornado activity right now is in and around the wichita, kansas, area. they are not out of the woods. i am sure the sirens are going off and people need to take shelter they know what to dobecause they see it every year. just to show you that severe threat, a wide-spread area affecting millions of people, 25 million people, really, in this swath or ""watch"" area, anywhere from minneapolis through dallas, texas, and a red shaded area where we think all of those ingredients are coming together right now for the potential of long-lasting destructive potentially life-threatening weather. oklahoma city, tulsa, joplin. joplin is coming up on the second anniversary of the deadly tornado and they are under the gun for large destructive damaging tornadoes and kansas city, too. this is not only going to be an event that will last today through the evening but even tomorrow. this is monday's let and as you can see it will move slowly eastward and some of the same cities are going to be potentially seeing the hail, thedamaging wind, the heavy rainfall and the possibility for more tornadoes. this is also going to move into tuesday across more populated rejoins of the ohio river valley, down toward the mississippi river valley into texas. it does not move very much. again, this area is used to this type of weather. however, when you see warnings and you see funnel clouds that are happening live on the screen, you know it is a very dangerous and imminent situation. these are dew points, the moisture in the atmosphere. the content, the moisture, very, very humid and that is the fuel that feeds the storms. we will not stress this enough, noaa, on, batteries in them. the warnings are going to comein and continue overnight. >>heather: thank you for the updates. i thank, also, randy duncan, the emergency manager of wichita. he was on the phone with us letting us know the danger is not done there and 25 million people are affected across the area, the wide-spread area where all of the storms are affecting the area tonight, tomorrow, through the day. damage on the ground is reported in wichita. you heard janice dean say the funnel cloud was confirmed to touch outside of oklahoma city, and people are dealing with hail, wind, rainfall, tornadoes, straight line winds. we will continue to update you on this at fox throughout the evening so stay tuned. we will be back after this quick break. we will look at all scandals rocking the white house this past week.

: FOXNEWS : June 16, 2013 3:00am-4:00am EDT",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2013,"i'll see you for the first news break. tweet me. i'll tweet you back. huckabee is now. >> you don't have to have done anything wrong. you simply the have to eventually fall under suspicion. >> he leaked classified information on the government surveillance of americans. is edward snowden a hero or trader? and is searching for terrorists by monitoring millions of phone calls, e-mails and web searches effective or more like trying to find a needle in a hay stack?   plus, $108 for antibiotic ointment, $77 for gauze pads. does obamacare address excessive healthcare costs. >> no, no, and no.if anything, it will raise the cost.   ladies and gentlemen, governor mike huckabee. [ applause ]   thank you. thank you very much. and welcome to huckabee from the fox news studios in new york city and a very happy father's day to everyone. well, at least to the fathers. all right. i have long advocated that we ought to pace the fair tax. that would eliminate taxes on income, saving, dividends, capital gains, inheritance and investments and replace these penalties on our productive with a tax on our consumption at the retail level. there's an important benefit that we, i think can all really embrace. it eliminates the irs. that's a good reason for it,right? [ applause ] >> well, in light of the illegal and unethical activities of the irs in relationship to conservative, pro-life and proisrael groups and the disregard for the taxes they take from us by spending $50 million online dancing classes and swag bags, maybe, just maybe the public is ready to end the legalized theft of our finances and our freedom. you see, another benefit of getting rid of the irs is stopping the government threat of losing tax-exempt status to shut down the voices of churches. now, i want you to think carefully about this and let me say, i doubt everybody is going to agree with me, but maybe, maybe it's time that churches quit caring about their tax-exempt status and care more about speaking with absolute freedom and clarity on the morale issues of the day. i brought this issue up lastweek. when i spoke to the pastors at the southern baptist convention in houston. now, i know i have never given a dime of my tithe because of the tax consequences. because for christians giving isn't about the getting the governments blessing but gods [ applause ] >> i mean, if somebody gives money to god solely for the tax benefits, then maybe that person ought to keep their money. they frankly need it worse than god does. you see, the empty threat that caused a pastor or church to water down their message because of fear of preprizels for the irs, that would stop. it isn't the place of any agency of the government to evaluate the content of the pastor's sermon and determine if that is acceptable to the government. even if the fair tax isn't passed immediately, why not endthe federal government subsidies to all entities and organizations religious or not and let freedom ring. now -- [ applause ] >> if you believe in something political, spiritual, even economic, then pay for it. leave the government out of it. for those that fear the churches would pay huge taxes, fear not, they use their funds for staff, and ministries. there's little if anything left over for most congregations. it wouldn't mean contributions wouldn't be deductible so there's already a limit so the benefit isn't that big. as daniel rejected the king's food maybe people of faith ought to reject the government's goodies but gain absolute freedom and instead of worrying about whether our message is threatened with governmentpenalty, we just tell the government to put it where the sun don't shine [ applause ] >> what we say and what we do in our churches ought to be driven by our faith, not by the government limits on our freedom. [ applause ] >> well, edward snowden, the former federal intelligence employee who leaked the information about the national security agency surveillance program on americans told the south china morning post that he's neither a traitor nor a hero. he says he's just an american but that hasn't stopped the debate here at home. so is snowden a hero or a traitor? bill is a former official with more than 30 years in the agency. he became a whistle blower and re-signed in 2001 after the program he created for foreign intelligence gathering was turned inward on this country.b steven yates is a former deputy assistant to vice president chaney and ceo of d.c. international advisory. he spent the first five years of his career at the national security agency. gentlemen. glad to have both of you here. >> thank you. >> bill, let me start with you. i don't think this is really so much about edward snowden as it is about the programs and their value to the country and whether or not they violate the constitutional rights of americans but i do want to ask, if your view, is edward snowden a good guy or a bad guy? >> well, i certainly think that what he has done in exposing these programs is a great public service. this kind of -- what i think of as unconstitutional activity by the government needs to be addressed by the public openly so we can, as a country, decide whether or not we want ourgovernment to do this kind of activity. after all, collecting this kind of knowledge about the citizenry is dangerous for the government to have. >> you left -- you left the nsa back in 2001 because you thought that there were some things happening even then, this was 12 years ago that crossed the line. what line did it cross and what was the final straw for you and you said that's it, i'm done? >> well it was because they started collecting billing data from the telecoms. the one that was initially participating was at&t; and they were given 200 million records of u.s. citizens talking to other u.s. citizens. that allowed you to reconstruct their entire calling community therefore you would know who is doing what with whom. so you could begin to reconstruct the tea party, any kind of organization you want. and then begin to see who is central to that organization ornot and target those accordingly. >> steve, how valuable is this information, first of all in it's collection? and how damaging is it that edward snowden has revealed the -- at least the parameters of the program? >> well, my assumption is that the data is extremely valuable in the work that the intelligence community is trying to do but it's not entirely their decision to make about what scope they have to gather and pursue leads here in the united states. that's something that is completely dependent upon what the judicial branch of government says and what the legislative branch says in exercising oversight. >> one of the questions is if it's so valuable how come it didn't stop boston or have anything to do with the underwear bomber, the shoe bomber, fort hood, little rock -- there are so many instances and it had nothing to do with stopping it so why are we collecting all of this data and if it's so valuable how come to this day we still haven'tsaid that fort hood is terrorism? those are legitimate things to be asking our government. tell us why we need this data. it doesn't seem to be working all that well for us right now. >> well, fair enough. i think it is never going to be a good tool to detect on going or forth coming attacks. what it has been when properly used and we could possibly find out it hasn't been properly used is after something has happened -- after a major lead has come in, people can go back and analyze this data to find out if someone acted alone or if there had been a pat herb of communications -- pattern of communications that could lead to a broader network. it's the post hoc utility that it could be used in the right hands and right constraints. >> let me pose this question to both of you. bill i'll start with you and then i want steve to answer. let's say this 29-year-old that's not a governmentemployee, he's a contractor and he's not a high level official. if he can get his hands on this and extract it obviously there's a lot of people that could get to this information. what gives us any confidence at all that somebody doesn't decide to manipulate the next presidential election by digging up all the phone records, the internet records, every photo that every presidential candidate has had and essentially blackmail everybody and completely control an election? comfort me here. bill, let me start with you and steve i'd like an answer from you. >> see, that's the fundamental problem with government having all of this knowledge about the population. one of the things that troubled me with the testimony that's come into congress about the irs activity by attacking or targeting individuals, one individual giving a testimony there said they were asked a question by the irs, what is your relationship with this other person and they gave a name. well, how do they know there's arelationship? well if you look into the met at a data of the program they know all of the relationships. so the question is how does the irs know about that relationship? they need to answer that because it looks to me like that's a result of this program. they're taking knowledge and redirecting it in a political way to target organizations that they don't particularly care for. >> all right steve, i'd like your response to this same thing. i do think it's fundamental. more important than who edward snowden is it's who else out there has this information. what could they do with it? >> they could do a tremendous amount with it. there's two pill laars it must rest. one is trust and one is targeting. any notion of trust in the federal government gathering and respecting the information it has is blown. there's going to have to be a major effort to restore trust. the nsa is very different from the irs but this whole general notion of trust in what thegovernment is doing is lost at the moment. targeting is where the current environment failed hmiserably i making sure that we're looking more narrowly at people that are real threats and real challenges. it's unacceptable to take a vacuum cleaner and hold on to the information. we have to have targeting in order for people to have trust and this to work. if you drowned yourself in information then boston bombers and other people basically hide in plain sight. >> all right. well, first of all, i don't think there's a lot of stuff on me but just in case there is, i don't want them holding on to it, okay. >> right. >> all right. bill and steven you'll rejoin us in a few minutes but first, should edward snowden be charged and tried as the traitor. the government has a better chance convicting him as a thief. he'll explain why when we come back.   i'd like to hear from you. go to mikehuckabee.cshould edward snowden be charged with a crime and if so, what should it be in order to extradite him back to the u.s. joining me is alan, great to have you here. >> nice to be here, thank you. >> now, this is going to be a fascinating case because, first of all, will this guy get extradited back to the u.s. and if so, will they be charged with the crime of theft. >> if they are smart they won't charge him with anything political at all. they'll charge him as a thief. he was working for a company, he did not own this material. he stole it. but maybe a good one. but he should be charged withtheft that why the governments won't have an excuse for not extraditing him. then they have to say where do we want him to land. if they land him in san francisco he gets a jury that will be very sympathetic. >> they'll give him a parade out there. >> if they land him at dallas airport he gets tried in northern virginia where the cia is located. >> he's cooked. >> he's cooked. so that will determine whether he is brought to trial. >> he himself thinks his life is over and will never see his family again. clearly he knows what he did was wrong but he believed it was necessary to release the information because he thought that the government was wrong. is that a legitimate defense to say i did what i did. yes i know i broke a law but the government is breaking a law. >> look it's what civil disobedients have done since the beginning of time. civil and political. but the rule of civildisobedience is you do the crime and pay the consequences. nelson mandela went to jail for civil disobedience, martin luther king. he maybe able to claim he's a civil disobedient. sometimes they get a jury that says maybe we shouldn't put him in jail but he has committed a crime. one of the problems is the law are so vague that the people that published it committed a crime, the washington post committed a crime. >> i think the post does that every time they publish a paper don't they alan? you don't have to respond to that. i couldn't leave it alone. go ahead. >> but there's a difference between a morale crime and a legal crime but it is legally a crime to publish material that you know is classified but they never go after legitimate newspapers for doing that. >> should they. >> well, there should be one law for everybody and we should change the law and make it clear whether the times publishingclassified material is or isn't a crime. if it is they should be prosecuted. they would challenge it or constitutional grounds. they might or might not win. we can't allow the government to pick or choose. going back to your opening statement here today which you'll be surprised that i agree with much of. i want the government out of deciding what the churches can say. you don't want the government to say new york times, that's good. if it's a radical newspaper like so and so, maybe it's not. we don't want to give the government any discretion as to which media to go after. the law has to be changed to make it absolutely clear what that red line is and when you cross it [ applause ] >> i would think there is a huge difference between a paper publishing the existence of a program and publishing operational details, names of agents, locations that could actually endanger somebody's life. that would have to be factored in, would it not? >> that should be part of the law. believe it or not, it's not today part of the law and it'sup to the newspapers to pick and choose what they're going to publish. a responsible newspaper is not going to publish the location of safe houses, the names of spies and weapons programs but the very publication of some of these super secret and very, very important some of them programs certainly do risk our national security. i think there's exaggeration on both sides. i do think that those that claim that this is the end all be all and stop all terrorism are overstating it. i also think those that think this is the end of the world from a civil liberty's point of view are overstating it. we have video cameras on every corner, that's very intrusive and that caught the boston bombers. we already have mail watchers -- do you remember what letters are? >> i heard of them. >> the government had the right to determine whether the mail was coming from, where it was being sent to. so this is not something new. what's new is the massiveness of it. the fact that we can do it to millions and millions of phonecalls and connect the dots and put everybody together. every time you get in your car and drive in the easy lane the government knows where you are. every time you make a phone call, call a taxi cab they can locate you. so already we live in this kind of big brother society. where we ought to draw the line is at content. i really think there's an enormous difference between the government knowing you made a phone call and the government being able to listen to the content of yourwe are back with alan, bill benny and steve yates. when we were talking before we got into the whole issue of how valuable this information is. let's pick it up from rightthere. and let me go to bill. bill, when you left the nsa, some of the things that we're seeing now are programs that you helped develop but you say it was intended to look at foreign sources, not u.s. is that the point that you feel like that our government has stepped across the line? >> yes it is. plus, the fact that they're collecting such bulk data. they were -- i left them with analytic principles like if you have a terrorist talk to somebody in the united states that was like the first degree. then the second degree would be who that person in the united states talked to. that formed a zone of suspicion and also you looked at who the people are that were looking at the advocating sites that advocate terrorism and then you add them to the zone of suspicion. that could have captured every terrorist i've ever known. that gives you a very focusedattack. what they're doing now is taking in all of this magnitude of much more data and it's making the job much more difficult. they're making themselves dysfunctional. >> that's to me an important question. we're getting so much information. we keep talking about the needle in a hay stack but are we making the hay stack so big we'll never find the needle. >> technology has changed a great deal and we have programs that can go after the data but i think that the principles that bill outlines are correct and should be guiding what the government is doing. a couple of the challenges we have is that we have foreign agencies, actors, terrorists, others that are going to be actively attacking our systems and surveilling us and our government needs to be monitoring a wider range of things than was technologically possible in 2000, 2001. we as consumer versus to recognize that when we give data voluntarily out into the cloud and by our consumer behavior it's not just companies using it. governments foreign and domesticwill get it too. we need to be smarter about that as consumers. >> is it a fair assessment to say there is a difference? it eludes to something you say before. we have cameras around on every street corner and we know that and there's companies monitoring our shopping preferences and we have to -- even if we never read the agreement, we do agree at some point but have we agreed that our government can keep that information? a public super market can prosecute me. the department of justice can. maybe i'm more willing to give that information to the super market than i am to the department of justice. >> there's no question about that. we know, too, that the younger generation is prepared to give up their privacy for community. they care more about community which is why they're prepared to live their lives openly on facebook. but they don't want the government to have that material. now i like what somebody said previously and that is this makes an enormous amount of sense in trying to solve crimes after they occurred becauseafter the fact you can then make connections that go way, way out. that's why we're collecting so much dna. talk about a problem. the dna problem. do you know within 10 or 15 years i predict every child born in america and perhaps in the world will have their dna taken at birth. there will be a universal dna bank and we don't have a firewall between using dna for personal identification as a fingerprint and looking into a person's dna. their genetics how long they're going to live. what diseases they're likely to get, whether they have propensities to violence and crime. dna is the key the government could use to unlock all of our privacy and the supreme court has not been focused on creating protections against that. >> where is that line, though, alan, between our constitutional right to be protected against search and seizure of our property and information and the government's necessary right to obtain information to stop badpeople? >> well, you know, the originalists say you go back to 1793 and say what the framers had in mind. the framers couldn't have contemplated dna banks, we have to ask ourselves where that line should be drawn. now where i draw the line is externality versus internality. i don't want the government to know what my dna says about my jeanet genetics. i am less concerned with them taking pictures of me walking down the street without knowing that i made a phone call here or there. that maybe the line we can live with. the line between externally seeing you and then internally finding out more about you. it's not a clear line and even the externalities involve great intrusions by being able to put the dots together and figuring out the internalities by learning so much about theexternalities. >> i'm a little comforted that this entire debate has not centered on republicans on one side democrats on the other. i have friends that see this 180 degrees differently than me and i'm frankly comforted by that. i want to say alan and bill and steve thank you all for being here and what i do hope is maybe if ed snowden didn't do anything else, he will force us to take a good, long, hard look at ourselves as a country, as a government and decide what are we willing to give up. is it worth it? if we're giving it up to protect our freedom but we give up our freedom to give it, did we give up what we were supposed to be protecting? that will be the question. thank you all for being here. [ applause ] >> our pleasure. >> well, you go to the hospital to heal your wounds and ailments but the bill at the end costs you an arm and a leg. coming up, an eye opening report on why medical costs are so high and how obamacare is not reallywith the spark miles card from capital one, bjorn earns unlimited rewas for his small business take theseags to room 12 please. [ garth ] bjors small busiss earns double miles on every purchase every day. produce delivery. [ bjorn ] just put it on my spark card. [ garth why settle for less? ahh, oh! [ garth ] great businesses deserve limited reward here's your wake up call. [ male announcer ] get the spark business card from capital one and earn unlimited rewards. choose double miles or 2% cash back on every purchase every day. what's in your wallet? [ crows ] now where's the snooze button?debris left behind. the unrest is sparked by government plans to build a mall in the square. now back to huckabee.   this summer the president is going to be touring the country, trying to sell obamacare all over again. well, could it be because polls continue to show that his healthcare overhaul is unpopular with most americans? a new fox news poll shows 55% oppose obamacare. that's compared to only 40% who are in favor of it. even members of congress including a lot of the democrats are contemplating quitting because of the premiums under the law. one of the problems of obamacare, though, and it doesn't even tackle a real issue, the outrageous hospital costs we face. let me take a look at you with some examples of what hospitals charge for medicines and supplies compared to what they would cost at the local drugstore or buying them online.we bought this box of sterile gauze pads for 7.50 at a nearby drugstore but some hospitals charge patients $77 for them. this antibiotic retail here, for about $6 a tube. guess what hospitals charge for this same item? $108. you got a headache? i bet you do now after hearing about what the hospital is charging. well, you can get 100 of these pain reliever pills for 1.50 online. 100 for 1.50. hospitals mark them up 100 times their street costs. they charge 1.50 per pill. steven wrote a very special report for time magazine called bitter pill. why medical bills are killing us. well i spoke to him recently about why hospitals charge so much.>> you spent 7 months trying to figure out why hospital costs were so high. where did that search take you? >> well it took me first and foremost to actual bills. i decided i didn't want to write some policy essay about healthcare and what i was concerned about is with all the debate in obamacare about who should pay for the high cost of healthcare, what kind of insurance should people have, how do we cover the high cost. i was concerned with why does it cost so much? so i took bills and looked at every item on the bill whether it was a charge of $13,000 for a cancer drug or $67 for a box of gauze pads and i traced who got all that money and how come and who is making out, you know, like a bandit and what i found is we basically had been living in two economies in this country for the last ten years. there's the economy where you and i know where people are hard pressed jobs are tight and money is tight and then there's the healthcare economy whereeverybody is doing really well except maybe the nurses and the doctors but the people that sell the equipment, the people that make the drugs, the people that run the allegedly nonprofit hospitals are all making ridiculous amounts of money. >> so you mean the doctors who spend 12, sometimes 15 years just preparing to be a doctor are making less money. >> far less unless they got in the system so they started a clinic where they can send patients or they're consulting for a drug company, they're not making the big bucks. the guys who make the cat scan equipment or the pharmaceutical sales men and executive, the hospital administrators, your local nonprofit hospital without even knowing it, i can tell you that the guy who runs your local hospital in little rock makes well over $1,000,000 and a half dollars a year. >> far more than the physicians are making who are savingpeoples lives. >> you know of all the people you want to get the most money for in the system, it's the guy who you are looking up at when you go into the emergency room. >> absolutely. >> or the operating room. >> will obamacare have an impact on lowering the cost? does it ooen address it. >> no, no and no. it will not lower the cost. if anything it will raise the cost but the reason obamacare was able to be passed is because all of the people who are making all the money are going to make more money because there's going to be more patients. >> so it's not going to help the consumer nor is it going to help the physician or the nurse. >> well it's going to help the consumer who will be forced to have the insurance protection that, you know, that many people think they should have. it will help that consumer. it will help someone who has a pre-existing condition because they will now be able to buy health insurance but because they'll be able to buy health insurance the premiums for everybody else are going to goup and for people that can't afford it the government is going to subsidize the premiums. the costs are going to go up. it does nothing to attack the $13,000 price for the drug transfusion or the $77 price for the gauze pads. it does nothing to deal with it. >> wow, when we come back, i want to ask you about something called the charge master. i find that to be one of thewe're cracking down on medicare fraud. the healthcare law gives us powerful tools to fight it... to investigate it... ...prosecute it... and stop criminals. our senior medicare patrol volunteers... are teaching seniors across the country... ...to stop, spot, and report fraud. you can help. guard your medicare card. don't give out your card number over the phone. call to report any suspected fraud. we're cracking down on medicare fraud. let's make medicare stronger for all of us.we're back with steven brill. i mentioned before the break something called the charge master. it sounds like a character out of ghost busters. the key master. what is the charge master? >> it's this thing nobody knows about except if you're in the medical world everybody knows about it. it's this massive three, four, 10,000 item list of the list prices that every hospital charges. so for a tylenol pill they might charge 1.50 even though it costs them less than a penny. for a transfusion of a drug it could be 10 or 15,000. those are the list prices. they use that to tell insurance companies we'll give you a discount off of the list prices. that sounds sort of seminumber. every item has a list price and you go into the car dealer and they lower it except there's noconsistency for any of the prices. no hospital administrator can tell you how they got the prices. it's not based on cost or based on anything. it's really a symbol of the fact that this isn't the marketplace. they feel no obligation to explain it and they can't because they literally can't explain it. >> this is like the charge master might say okay, we're going to charge $10,000 for a heart stint in this hospital. another hospital might charge 5,000. >> it would be 2,000 at another hospital and yet the hospital where it's 2,000 could charge six times what the other hospital charges for something else. there's no rhyme or reason. >> no standard. >> no and it's all unaccountable. no one ever had to explain it because if you're in the marketplace the seller has all the power. >> and the patient doesn't pay attention because generally the person who is receiving theservice, the patient is not the one actually paying the bill. the insurance company, the third party, is that part of the real problem we have. >> except in the crazy world of healthcare economics the patients that do pay the bills are the ones that don't have insurance. in your home state there are probably thousands of people being sued by hospitals for charge master prices, the high prices, that causes 61% of the personal bankruptcies in this country. so there's no accountability. there's no rational for it and nobody can explain it but nobody has to explain it. now that, you know, deductibles are getting higher and people are going to go into insurance exchanges, everybody is starting to think about what healthcare costs because more people have more skin in the game. when they see those prices, you know, there maybe the kind of disgust that will cause things to change. >> how do we fix this? this is out of control and nobody can really even understand it.it's like a language only the -- >> we are the only country in the world that decided we want to live under the illusion that we can treat medical care, as if it's a real marketplace, you know where the buyer has any power. the buyer doesn't have any power. every other country interseeds. the $13,000 bill for the drug transfusion for the cancer care patient in my article, that would be 4 or $5,000 in germany or france or england and yet the drug companies, they sell like crazy there. they make a lot of money on 4 or $5,000. so there has to be some intersessiinte intercession in the marketplace so there's real power, the buyer has. where it begins has to be the kind of, you know, complete transparency i intended to do with the article. >> is that enough or will it be a second step of government regulation. >> the first step is telling me i'm supposed to pay the $13,000for the drug or the $77 for the gauze pad. that's nice. that's good. but if i don't have any choice, that's not enough. something has -- there have to be regulations. oddly enough, the only entity that really has power is, you know, medicare. they do it really efficiently unless your viewers get all excited, i should underscore the fact that medicare is actually mostly run by the pirate sector. there are like 600 government employees and something like 8,000 employees in the private sector that do a wonderful job administering healthcare. >> thank you for the article bitter pill. it is a bitter pill. appreciate you being here. >> happy to be here governor. >> thank you. >> one of adele's biggest hits >> one of adele's biggest hitsthey is become an internet phenomena taking chart topping hits and giving them a classical twist. the dozens of video hes have received over 225 million views online. a brand new cd called the piano guys volume 2. welcome john schmidt and steven nelson the piano guys. >> thank you very much. >> steven, you guys started out doing some of the you tube videos and it just took off like crazy. what was the genesis of the piano guys? >> t started out as a piano store and paul anderson wanted to promote the sale of the pianos. he started recruiting music yans to play songs to promote the sale of the pianos. >> we were selling less and less pianos and making more and more videos. >> are you surprised at howyoutube has turned something like what you guys do into an international event? >> yeah, all i can say is youtube works. you know, suddenly we are are touring all over the world and we are just a couple of dads. i mean they call us cullde sac because we pull up to the gig in our mini van. >> we will do living with the dig with a little bit of june it territory. >> this particular cut has already received over 12 about million views on youtube. pretty phenomenal. >> thank you. >> let's hear it. >> all right. ♪♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [ applause ] >> the piano guys! thank you guys so very much for being here. we love it. hope people will get the music at amazon or on itunes.remember the piano guys. thanks for joining us. hope you have a wonderful week. until next time from new york this is mike"

Report With Bret Baier : FOXNEWS : April 30, 2013 6:00pm-7:00pm EDT",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2013,"that. >> hit me on twitter with a good idea. that's all i got. >> dana: that's it. we'll see you tomorrow. special report is hum up next. >> bret: president obama tries to clarify just where that red line is for syria. he is asked about benghazi testimony. this is ""special report."" good evening. i'm bret baier. our series of reports on the benghazi terror attack and new allegations of intimidation and stonewalling from the administration in just a minute. first, president obama is trying to soft pedal phrases such as ""red line"" and ""game changer"" when it comes to syria and chemical weapons and substitute words like we don't know and would have to re-think.the complex and contradictory situation with syria part of a wide-ranging news conference this morning. ed henry our man on the front row. >> this time president obama never used the phrase ""red line,"" instead hedging on the threat he made just eight months ago that the use of chemical weapons by syrian president assad. >> we don't know who when who used them, we don't have a chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened. >> none of those caveats were highlighted when the president made this vow last august. >> a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. that would change my calculus. >> despite his own defense secretary chuck hagel and other top officials now declaring there is evidence chemical weapons have been used in syria, the president hinted at themistakes made in iraq to say he needs to have clear facts to tie the weapons directly to assad. >> if i can establish in a way that not only the united states but also the international community feel confident is the use assad regime. then that is a game changer. >> u.s. military action? >> by game changer i mean that we would have to re-think the range of options that are available to us. >> former senator joe lieberman said that since over 70,000 syrians have already been slaughtered, he was troubled by mr. obama's staples today. >> we can't let this red line become fuzzy in a lot of international lawyering and the united nations. >> the president's hesitation may be reflected in a new cbs news, ""new york times"" poll which found nearly two chirdz ofthe american public does not want military intervention. on the question of whether the u.s. has a responsibility in syria, 62 percent said no. 24 percent said yes. the syrian regime is trying to use that weariness to insist assad is being framed. >> what happened in iraq as i said is still alive in our minds. our region, ladies and gentlemen, is still living the consequences of such false allegations there are new signs tonight the white house may give lethal aid to the rebels in syria. rather than just the nonlethal aid they have been giving. katelyn telling me a moment ago vehicles, armor, night vision goggles among the items now under discussion. what's significant about that it would give the white house a chance to show they are being more aggressive about the situation in syria. but still a step short of actual direct u.s. military intervention. bret. >> bret: okay, ed.and the president was asked about gitmo today. >> he was. remember, this was a big broken promise, first week in office the president said he would close gitmo within one year in office. today he blamed congress saying they have blocked his efforts republican buck mckean fired back that the president out never put forth a real bipartisan plan that would work. the bottom line at this news conference today the president said he will now in a second term saying he will redouble his efforts to close gitmo in this second term. there is clear signs tonight there is going to be major battle on his hands to get that done, bret. >> bret: information we broke for you last night on an alleged campaign of threats and intimidation against possible whistleblowers tied to the benghazi terror attack. chief washington correspondent james rosen has new reaction tonight. >> the state department pushed back against charges first aired monday on fox news alleging that benghazi whistle blowers preparing to cooperate withcongressional investigators have faced threats from superiors at foggy bottom. >> we have to demittologyize this issue and depoliticize it. the american people deserve answers and i'm determined this is going to be accountable and transparent state department as it has in the past. >> the state department would never retaliation whistle blowers on any issue, including this one. that's an obligation we take very seriously full stop. processdent obama 'fessed to be unaware of long standing efforts by g.o.p. lawmakers to question survivors from the benghazi attacks of september 11 in which terrorists killed the u.s. ambassador to libya and three other americans. >> i'm not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying. so what i will do is i will find out what exactly you are referring to. >> on monday, former justice department official victoria toensing identified herself as one of the attorneys representing the so-calledwhistleblower. still the obama administration says no such whistleblowers have come over or review classified materials. republican congressman darrell issa of california wrote to the state department number two april mccloud april 16th. attorneys representing department personnel in this matter will require clearance to possess top secretive compartmented information. >> they have had two letters from chairman issa. one on april 16th. the other one april 26th that specifically say we want you to provide a process for clearing a lawyer to receive classified information. how can they possibly get up there and just lie to the press corps? >> and that's why we need to give them immunity. that's why we need a congressional investigation. the administration has lost its credibility. >> fox news has learned that the house oversight and government reform committee chaired by congressman issa will hold a fresh round of hearings on benghazi, bret, with the first of them slated to occur on wednesday of next week. >> okay, james, thank you.president obama promised to get to the bottom of the benghazi attack. why are the perpetrators still free? correspondent adam housley has part 2 of our exclusive investigation. >> make no mistake. justice will be done. >> seven months and still no arrest or targeted killings after the brutal attack on two u.s. locations in benghazi, libya, killing four americans. despite promises that those responsible would be hunted down and held accountable. however, multiple sources tell fox news that the u.s. has identified benghazi attack who was still in libya and walks free. >> we basically don't want to upset anybody. and the problem is if ambassador stevens' family knew that we were sitting on information about the people who killed their son, their brother, and we could look them as a government in the face, then we are messing up. we're messing up. >> fox news spokeexclusively with this special operator who watched the events unfold in realtime and debriefed those who were part of the response. he remains anonymous for his safety and has decided to talk because he says he and others connected with the september 11th attacks of benghazi are frustrated with the executions, lies and lack of a military response since ambassador chris stevens and three other americans were killed. >> we have all the capability, all the training, all the capacity to kill and capture that only terrorist involved with the specific events of 9/11 and ambassador stevens' death with terrorists who are feeding other regions, including europe that eventually could effect our national security in the short-term. we're not talking midterm or long term. this is short-term. >> the community is pretty frustrated? absolutely. it's a daily frustration. >> another threat, a larger terrorist haven that continues to build in parts of libya and north africa.those working the region in the united states security plainly the ball is being dropped by people at the white house, pentagon and state department. >> the second highest population of foreign fighters in the war in iraq came from benghazi. second to saudi arabia. so we are talking about historic location and region that has fed foreign fighters to kill americans and kill other coalition forces the analysts, intelligence experts that i work with all say the same thing that if we just ignore the situation, as it presents itself, eventually another invasion will have to take place for us to eventually turn the tide. >> he says the region also remains a weapons hub. after the overthrow of former leader muammar qaddafi in 2011 which saw massive stockpiles of weapons in libya move freely across themediterranean many cases in syria. remove shoulder launched missiles called man pads, some americans working the area say they are not allowed to take or even destroy the missiles because they have not been given the authority from their chain of command. >> i have come across se 7's in the hands of friendly forces, meaning, you know, surrogate, military, or police forces that wanted to be handed over and i was unable it to do that because there was no program in place, no government organizations were interested, no special operations organizations were interested. >> is it frustrating knowing that these potential friendly forces or friendly people on the ground there were willing to pass along something that could fall into the hands of an adversary and there was no plan in place to do it? >> it was frustrating not only for myself before themen and the guys that i work with. we always talk amongst each other and discuss that, you know, it's probably going to take a 747,a 757 to get shot down in tripoli for somebody to pay attention though that, which is unfortunate. >> bret, looking for a response to the charge, that the possible mastermind has been identified and walking around in libya. we reached out to the state department and cia. the pentagon, and the fbi. and we received no official response or comment. bret? >> bret: okay, adam, part three tomorrow. thank you. could a wedding cake be a messy affair for a rising political star? that's later in the grapevine. and up next, what happened just before this scene? the shocking final seconds of a doomed cargo flight in afghanistan. ♪[ male announcer ] pain not sitting too well? burning to feel better? itching for relief? preparation h offers the most maximum

were killed today in roadside bombs bombing. no word if they were americans. nine afghan civilians in what the taliban calls spring offensive. the suspect in the boston marathon bombings is getting some heavyweight legal help now. meanwhile, the administration is trying to tamp down murmurs that law enforcement and intelligence did a light weight job chasing down information before the attack. here is chief intelligence correspondent catherine herridge. >> when tamerlan tsarnaevreturned from russia in giuliani last year. he set up his own youtube channel. two sources familiar with the case tell fox news investigators have found no evidence the 26-year-old created his own jihadi videos, a step seen by the intelligence community as a sign of radicalization. a new internal review will examine the intelligence leading up to the boston marathon bombings and whether russian warnings that tamerlan was a follower of radical islam were adequately investigated and adequately shared with the u.s. government. >> based on what i have seen so far, the fbi performed its duties, department of homeland security did what it was supposed to be doing. but, this is hard stuff. >> with the traditional al qaeda leadership under pressure in the tribal areas of pakistan and in afghanistan, the president acknowledged that tsarnaev brothers appear to be poster boys for a new generation of domestic terrorists who sympathies lie with radical islam andactions fueled by the web. >> in some cases may not be part of any kind of network, but because of whatever warped, twisted ideas they may have may decide to carry out an attack. >> according to the justice department, at least seven alleged cases of homegrown terrorism have been brought in the federal courts since december. to thwart future attacks like boston, the president is calling on his counter terrorism team. >> we want to leave no stone unturned. we want to see is there, in fact additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack. >> the 19-year-old suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev who remains under watch in this massachusetts prison hospital has a new addition to his legal team. judy clark whose provous cases include unabomber ted kaczynski will join threeperchedz. >> considered expert in death penalty. reduced client from death

s&p; 500 gained 4 to post another record high.the nasdaq finished ahead 22. president obama once again today tried to put as much daylight as possible between himself and sequester cuts. chief conessional correspondent mike emanuel tells us what the president said and the swift republican response. >> it slowed our growth. resulting in people being thrown out of work. and it's hurting folks all across the country. >> president obama says his warnings about sequestration are coming true and blamed congress. today a spokesman for house speaker john boehner responded, quote: the american people are still asking where are the jobs and the president still has no solutions for them. the president had a lot more excuses than answers today. over the weekend, a key house lawmaker noted his colleagues tried to do more to address the cuts. >> sequestration is bad policy, the wrong way to reduce the deficit. that's why house republicans have voted twice to replace these automatic cuts with smarter once. >> even though congress passed a fix late last week to allow the transportation secretary to move moneyaround to avoid furloughs and reduce flight delays, the president did not sound happy. >> the fact that congress responded to the short-term problem of flight delays by giving us the option of sifting money that's designed to repair and improve airports over the long-term to fix the short-term problem. that's not a solution. >> democrats run happy because flight delays were addressed while meals on wheels, head start and other domestic programs are dealing with less. republicans say it was the white house that decided to use flight days a as political weapon. >> it wreaks of politics. that's exactly what it is. they have got the resources. they have got the manpower and they have a declining demand. everything that the f.a.a. needs to do, they could have done already. >> today oklahoma republican senator tomko burn sent interior secretary sally joule a

the red line. america's credibility. benghazi. let's bring in our panel. steve hayes, senior writer for ""the weekly standard,"" kirsten powers columnist for the daily beast and syndicated columnist charles krauthammer. charles? >> syria first. >> chain of custody? what is this csi damascus?in the middle of a war you expect a chain of custody and decide if a weapon was used? look, this is a president who sees himself as a liberal reformer. he remembers what happened to lgj. he knows what happened to george bush. you get involved in a foreign war, your presidency is ruined. and i think he has been determined from the first instant with syria that he would not allow himself to be dragged. in i think the reason he put out this supposed red line about chemical weapons is that he imagined, a, it wouldn't be used or that it was a way to actually postpone a decision until the future. and now that he has this kind of, you know, he doesn't have an overwhelming instance as we had in the saddam days where he -- saddam attacked the village from the air and killed thousands of people in one day, in the absence of that, i don't think he will allow any evidence to compel him to engage in militaryactivity. i think that's where he starts from. and all over this stuff dancing around it, he is not going to allow himself to get involved. >> bret: kirsten nine months ago he said red line for us is is if we see nuclear weapons moving around or change my calculus. today it was a different calculus all together. >> look, i'm a big fan of getting all the facts before do you anything. i understand his point, you don't want to make mistake. but the facts seem to be fairly clear here. and he is the one who drew the red line. this is a difficult situation and i have been saying all along it's hard to say what you can do in syria. if the president is going to come out, draw a red line and then not act on it, what does that say to other people? what does that say to any other person in the future, any other country in the future when you come out and you say don't cross this line? once you have said that and the line has been crossed, you have to do something. >> bret: which is why perhaps tonight we are hearing from the white house that they areincreasing or considering lethal aid increasing. >> there is going to be a lot of considering of a variety of proposals. i don't expect that we are going to see much action on them. you don't have to go back nine months to find the administration contradicting itself on this. go back to the briefing given to white house reporters last thursday by senior white house official. the president today in his press conference basically said we don't know. we don't know anything we don't know if it was the regime or anything about this. last thursday a senior white house administration official said we believe that any use of chemical weapons in syria would likely have originated with the assad regime. he went on to say we are very skeptical that reports of the use of chemical weapons could be anyone other than the assad regime. they knew or they thought they knew or they were telling the world that they knew last thursday. now the president is giving the press conference in which he says basically we know that this is what the intelligence community is telling us but we really don't know. that kind of a message to the world, i think doestremendous damage to american credibility. >> let's talk about benghazi. the questions that we raise here, stories that we brought forward about a number of different survivors, whistleblowers tied to the benghazi attacks coming forward, really getting lawyers that want to testify. asked about that today. >> ed, i'm not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying. so, what i will do is i will find out what exactly you are referring to. what i have been very clear about from the start is that our job with respect to benghazi has been to find out exactly what happened. to make sure that u.s. embassies not just in the middle east but around the world are safe and secure. and to bring those to justice. i will find out what exactly you are referring to. >> hired an attorney because they say they havebeen blocked from coming forward. >> i'm not familiar with it. >> bret: the president is not familiar with it lawmakers like senator john mccain are. >> we are being told that these people are being intimidated, they are being told that it would be the end of their career if they come forward. and that's why we need to give them immunity. that's why we need a congressional investigation. the administration has lost its credibility. >> charles? >> he hadn't heard about it it? nobody in the white house has heard about it? nobody at the white house has access to fox news? this is slightly incredible. it's rather weak response for the president. he knew he was going to be calling on ed henry as the first question because of his role in the white house, the correspondence association. he knew that fox or at least his staff knew that fox had broken the story, spent a lot of effort on this story and time on the story last night. and he pretends he neverheard of it? call me skeptical. >> bret: kristen. >> i think it's possible he has heard of it because i don't think the white house has taken the benghazi story all that seriously. they may have also not told the president about it because they don't want him to have to answer any questions about it this is a white house that actually has a pretty storied history of intimidating whistle blowers. it's not something the president is going to want to talk about. i'm looking forward to the people coming forward so we can actually hear what they have to say. >> bret: couple quick polls here, steve. benghazi coverup question then and now from 2008 to now. there you see is the obama administration covering up what happened in benghazi. slight change down to now. 46% yes. 43% no. next question, if necessary for the investigation, should congress subpoena benghazi survivors. look as the this. 67% say yes. i think a lot of people like kirsten want to hearfrom survivors of this attack. >> i would say if people were paying attention to every twist and turn of the story those numbers would be much higher. it leakily looks that the administration is involved in off ifification if not coverup. bring those who carried it out to justice. where are we on that question? we have had one suspect released by the tunisians lawyer present. another suspect who has been in egyptian custody and they have denied us access to him. and we have got another suspect who is in some custody somewhere but we don't know. it's been nearly 8 months. where are we on this question of who perpetrated these attacks and are we going to find them? how often? how long is the president going to say that i'm determined to track them down and bring them to justice when people actually take that seriously. it's been 8 months. come on. >> bret: adam housley's source says the mastermindof the attack has been identified and libya is walking free. we will see where this committee hearing goes. you think it will be explosive? >> look. as long as the press outside of this network ignores it, i'm not sure it will be. why hasn't anybody asked the president what's happening on the libya investigation? how can the president have a press conference 17 hours after you broke story and pretends he doesn't know about it nobody asked him about that that's what i find astonishing, as long as the media doesn't want to look at this as in the abortion trial, the gosnell trial, it's not a story. >> can i just say real quickly. >> bret: ed henry asked about it. >> this is though where you see the greatest manifestation of media bias. it's not in all of the thumbing of the scales. it's in the what's news question? if you get eye rolls any time you mention benghazi among other reporters from mainstream outlets, this is the way that the story isgoing to be covered or not covered. >> bret: this is how gosnell started. it's changed a little bit now. next up, president obama's promises on imawb. healthcare reform and his warnings on the sequester and the rest. global broadband network and custom communications solutions, your business is more reliable - secure - agile. and with responsive, dedicated support, we help you shine every day of the week.>> congress has ignored your efforts to try to get them to undo the sequester cuts. there was even a bill that you threatened to veto that got 92 democrats in the house voting yes. so, my question to you is: do you still have the juice to get the rest of your agenda through this congress? >> if you put it that way, jonathan. [ laughter ] maybe i should just pack up and go home, golly. i think it's a little, asmark twain said, rumors are my demise maybe a little exaggerated at this point. >> bret: president obama's first 100 days, press conference today. we're back with the panel. charles? >> pack up and go home? not a bad idea. look, i think the essence of this is that obama was really riding high. elections day answered crushes the republicans on the fiscal cliff answered thinks he is the king of washington. and he has got an open road and then all of a sudden, he runs into sequester, the republicans called the administration plouffe and they won on that. the administration has been embarrassed. on all of the elements of sequester. they had to cave on air traffic control which is going to be a way to push the republicans into accepting tax hikes on gun control. the president was unable to get the minimal of what he wanted. simply a reporting. and on background checks. he has had a really badcouple of months. i think the momentum out of election day is over. is he treading water right now. >> he was asked kirsten about a standoff at gitmo, basically a sit-in, starvation basically by the gitmo detainees. take a listen to his answer. >> congress determined that they would not let us close it. and despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in guantanamo, hot the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country, i'm going to go back at this. >> bret: going to go back at this. going to try to close guantanamo bay. >> going to do that on his third term. >> this is something he railed against in the campaign. something a complete blemish on the united states in my opinion. en i don't quite understand why he is so helpless.it's not a priority. probably the first time he mentioned it. he was asked about it. thingirst 100 days things arbitrary and unfair to the president. he hasn't had a great start to his second term but at the same time, you know, i don't know that all of that is his fault. the gun control stuff is -- was a little bit out of his hands because i think congress is so under the sway of the nra. there is still a lot of time for him to get perhaps a big deal on immigration which would be a big win for him. >> bret: i should clarify the detainees are not taking meals. they are being force fed liquids and being sustained there but, it is a standoff with the guards. on obama care, steve, the president said that it is going to be implemented but it could get sticky. and like any government program he says everything won't be perfect. there will be glitches and bumps. there will be a lot ofstories. bumpy along the way. >> i suspect this is the kind of comment that will strike people who are listening to this as home as totally out of touch. the president is basically asserting that there is no difficulty with the implementation of obama care and that those people who are either confused or are having difficulty following the rules or standing the rules have their own problems. for the people who are actually having those problems, they are not going to be persuaded by the president insisting that they are not having those problems. so i think this is an argument that's not going to make a heck of a lot of sense. what was more curious in my mind is when the president in fact said 85% of obama care has been implemented and we have got 15% basically deals with these uninsured or underinsured people but if you are not in that group, you are not going to have to worry about it. that is complete and utter nonsense on stilts. if you look at the people who are having to deal with this question right now, it's small businesses who don't know if you have 50 employees or less. are you going to be subject to these new regulations.if you co-own a business with your father or your mother, are you going to have to split the business in two? these are the kind of questions that small businesses are trying to answer every single day in consultation usually with a team of lawyers right now. for the president to down play that, it's not an argument he can win because this is going to get more difficult as we go along, not less. >> bret: senator max baucus in recent testimony, democrat from montana who said the implementation was a train wreck in his eyes. so we will see. that's it for the panel. stay tuned for the latest innovative idea that some consumers appear to be embracing. ♪ [ male announcer ] pain not sitting too well?

remainedpeaceful. in sanford, louisiana, local churches will be opening their doors at noon for community prayer. they are trying to get people on both sides to talk about the issues. martha: the and of six women deliberated for just over 16 hours. at one point asking for clarification on the definition of manslaughter. in the end, george zimmerman was found not guilty. an walked out of the court. there is his wife. a free man at the end of all that. the prosecutors reacted. >> let me make sure i say it clearly. i respect the jury verdict. i believe wholeheartedly we live in the greatest country in theworld. but i'm disappointed i have tried 300-something cases and this is only my section murder case is lost. i'm disappointed because i believed he was guilty. but what matters is what the jury says. bill: the defense team reacting to the verdict with mixed emotions. >> i'm sure if he could wave his magic wand he would get his life back. but now that jury decided he acted properly in self-defense we can give him understanding now after several traumas. >> i think it's disgraceful. i'm gratified by the jury'sverdict. as happy as i am for george zimmerman, i'm thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty. for that we are eternally grateful. but it make me sad, too, that it took this long under these circumstances to finally get justice. bill: trayvon martin's parents were not in the court when the verdict was read for george zimmerman. they did not hold a press conference or make a statement. a spokesperson said they went back home to attend church sunday morning. here is what their pastor had to say. >> we are angry but we are controlling and we are going to channel our anger. the bible says be angry but sinnot. we are not going to forget the verdict, we are not going to forget george zimmerman weeb we are not going to forget this trial. far * president obama drawing attention at the beginning of all of this when he said if he had a son he would look like trayvon. after the verdict the president had this to say. quote. i know this case elys he his elg passions i ask for calm reflections as two parent who lost their young son. bill: zimmerman's troubles could be far from over. the justice department saying it's restarting it own investigation on whether zimmerman violated it civil right. right.s. a justice department spokesperson saying quote experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether there was a violation of the federal civil rates statutes and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the government policy follow regarding prosecution following a state trial. will that happen? reaction from sheen hayes on that moment away. martha: a heap of trouble for one of the fastest growing sectors of the u.s. economy. more restaurants are reportedly replacing full-time workers with the part-time workers because the understand mandate is takinga bite out of their bottom line. good morning stuart. i'm in your neck of the woods. >> reporter: my old neck of the woods. martha: you are in new jersey. close enough. report there are i'm a jersey boy at heart. what you are talking about is obama-care. here it comes. there is a shift in hiring patterns because obama-care is coming. it's ironic that some of the people who were supposed to be helped most by obama-care are going to be hurt the most by it. here is the example. currently it costs an average of $15,745 for an employer to provide healthcare for an employee with a family. $15,000. that's a lot of money. that's for full timers. so what many toronto chains are doing is hiring part-timers, not full-timers.this is true of the leisure industry and the economy overall. employers do not want to be on the hook for all of that extra healthcare cost that's coming count pique pike at them. even though that employer mandate has been delayed for a year until january of 2015. restaurant chains, hotel operations and the companies in general are taking steps to get away from that employer mandate. martha: it would seem now would be the time. they don't want to wait a year then move somebody to part time from full time who has gotten used to that position. what are the implications in that for the u.s. economy? >> reporter: this is not what we want to hear. what we need is more full-time well paid jobs. if many industries shift to part time jobs then payrolls go down. the number of hours worked goes down.paychecks go down. and you have got industry scrambling to provide part-time work as opposed to ful full fulo full-time work. we may be growing at less than 2% annual growth rate as of right now. not good. martha: stuart, thank you very much. i'll tell you one thing that may help the economy in the united kingdom and that would be the birth of a future king or queen and that's what brings us here today. here is a look at the lindo wing of the st. mary's hospital where reporters have been camped out since july 8. we'll show you a shot of the rows of ladders and setup.waiting for the big moment when this baby is announced. those poor reporters have been out in the heat for the last 7 days waiting for this. the due date is expected to have been yesterday, july 14, but nobody knows for sure. mid-july is all that the palace released on this. whether it's a boy or girl, the queen changed the law. if it is a girl and there was speculation that kate let it slip a little bit, that child would be next in line after her father prince william for the throne. we'll see. bill: the question is how long are you going to be there? you are on baby watch. you could be there for a while. martha: maybe god and maybe thequeen can answer that question. prince william was playing polo this weekend and the duchess was at her parents. the prince can get anywhere he needs to go center quickly. but they are trying to play it cool as most young couples do. you don't want to jump the gun. bill: i'm thinking 3 weeks in london is just about right for you. back with if you london in a moment. a couple of the stories here including a key vote that could happen soon on capitol hill. what republicans want to delay on the new healthcare law. we'll tell you what that's all about. martha. martha: sounding the alarm on iran's nuclear program. what israel's prime minister says will happen if the red lineis crossed. >> they had eight months ago 8 kilos, so they are edging up to the red line they won't be allowed to cross. ♪[ male announcer ] we all deserve a good night's sleep. thankfully, there's

reopening its embassy in egypt. it had been closed the last two weeks following violent protests between supporters of morsi and troops. byrnes is the first senior official to visit egypt since morsi left. bill: the federal government is looking at whether to pursue a civil rights case against george zimmerman. he was found not guilty ofsecond degree murder and not guilty of manslaughter. >> we have been down this road before. such destructive behavior. it's not the proper tactic to deal with this pain. a civil lawsuit, yes. department of justice intervention, yes. bill: steven hayes, a fox news contributor. good morning to you. what do you think the federal government will do. will they pursue a federal case here? >> i think eric holder would like to. there will be considerable political pressure to do just that. eric holder is going tomorrow to orlando, florida well be address the naacp and they have already called for pursuit of a federal case.i think eric holder would probably like to do this and we have seen from the administration a willingness to stretch the bounds of the law to make it case. i think holder would like to do it but the bigger question in my mind is whether president obama would like to do it. bill: the president said the jury has spoken. >> he did. but the administration has shown whether you are talking about recess appointments or obama-care, the administration has shown itself willing to stretch the bound of the law and pursue thing that some might have counseled them not to. bill: he said i think the justice department is going look at this. this isn't over with and i think that's goo.that's the senate majority leader. where is the talk about the jury did it work and that's what they found and we have to live with it. >> there are many, many people making those comments. the justice department did start an investigation that they put on hold as the state pursued its own prosecution. the statement from the justice department suggests they will revisit these charges and see if they can bring zimmerman up on additional charges. bill: you will see previously filed fieg document. fbi agents interviewed dozens of people in the course of probing possible racial bias but nobody would say zimmerman showed such bias before the shooting. >> that and fundamental problem.they would have to be able to get a conviction in an environment that's going to be much more difficult than the state had because they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt this motivation behind george zimmerman's actions. many people told the fbi that was not necessarily the motivation. you have one of the trayvon martin family's own attorneys, darrell parks, told ""the washington post"" during the trial that they couldn't go to racial motivation and they didn't have the facts to support that kind of case. you see that challenge for the justice department in addition to the basic structural charges when you bring this type of civil rights case. bill rfer bac --bill: back to london and martha. martha: the dave reckoning is fast a -- the day of reckoning is fast approaching with iran and their nuclear program. itmen. itmen. and

>> they are making it more difficult for the average iranian. they are not going to do anything to stop their nuclear program unless they believe their regime is threatened. not on do they control the region, but they control the strait of hormuz. guess what comes from that region, oil. iran is not just the most powerful country in the region bus of its nuclear weapons. it also controls the world's hoyle supply. i was in israel two months ago and i noticed a distinct difference. there was a lot more self-confidence in who the israelis are. there was less hand ringing, is the united states with us, can we count on president obama. there was a sense in israel whosaid israel can take care of itself. if we have to we'll do waste is, sabotage, espionage, military strikes against iran and we can ride it out even if the youth does not come our assistance. martha: that's the tone netanyahu has taken and it sounds like the has spread into confidence the people are picking up on as well. bill: the president's healthcare law taking a big hit. karl rove joins us next. futures are up. we'll see how the markets impact your 401k.bill: a record for the dow. on wall street the dow is about to open up. what in the world is going on? it's earnings season. earnings are good and the market's move on this news. we have seen 25 record closes for the dow already in the year 2013. another high close friday. pushing 15 -- pushing 15,500. martha: back in london we'll go to capitol hill. house republicans are goingafter obama-care again. threat they will vote to delay the requirement that most americans need to buy health insurance after the white house decided to delay the mandate that businesses provide health insurance to their employees. >> if you are a software company making billions in profits you are exempt from obama-care. but if you are a 28-year-old struggling to pay off your student loans you are not. is it fair for the president to give american businesses an exemption from the health law's mandates without giving the same break to individual and families across the country? hell, no, it isn't. martha: karl rove, former white house chief of staff to president george w. bush. this is another effort about it gop to try to derail obama-careand delay the individual mandate and have it match up with the employer mandate to kick in. will it work? >> it will be a talking point. the house will take up two majors. it will pass them then they will go over and die in the that. one is by todd young of indiana that would delay for one year the individual mandate. the requirement that as of january 1 individuals have health insurance or pay a fine. there is a second measure that would validate the president's decision to delay the employer mandate for a year. this is to draw attention to the fact that the president has no statutory authority to delay it for a year. they are saying the president didn't have the authority to do it but they are happy to provide it. it will help educate the american people about the short comings of it taint will allowthe republicans to make the point that the president's decision to delay the employer mandate was all about politics. he's worried in 2014 he doesn't want companies particularly businesses, to pay a fine for every worker below 30 for failing to provide health insurance coverage. martha: when you look at the mid-term elections do republicans need more to run on than just well we tried and tried and tried in the house to get this thing delayed or shot down? >> i think you are absolutely right. the house voted 35 times to repeal obama-care. they will vote to delay portions of obama-care. that's good. but it's insufficient. and there is a lot of discussion among republicans on the hill about offering an alternative package around republicans canrally, allowing people to buy insurance across state lines and allowing small businesses to pool together to get the same advantage big companies get. the self-employed are better able to provide insurance coverage and people can take their benefits with them from job to job. but there will and lot of discussion about that and people in the house and senate are talking about it. there are a number of republicans laying out those packages. we are look at pressure to have those vote upon in the spring and winter of next year. martha: this letter that was written to nancy pelosi and harry reid from an interesting source. it comes from the team sisters and other union --i it comes from the teamsters and otherleaders. it says we are not getting something we were proimed. it under out to be something we dnld expect or sign on for. >> late last week the head of the teamsters, jim hoffa and the head of the hospitality deterrell and food and commercial workers. mostly people who work in grocery stores. sent a tough letter to pelosi and reid. they quoted the president, the president told us if we liked what we had we could keep it. they then detailed the how the affordable care act is making it impossible for them to keep their non-profit insurance in place and they don't get the subjects does and they are taxed $63 a month if they don't getthe benefits of the affordable care act. their concern is this will make unionized workers less attractive. and it will be less attractive to hire unionized workers. they make a tough statement saying we provide the phones, the workers, the election he distance, we raise money for you and this is how you are treating us. this is a very tough letter. martha: let me just read one sentence from it. it says news meaning nancy pelosi and harry reid and the obama administration enact an equitable fix,ed the aca will heart our hard-earned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek that is the foundation of the american middle class. these are solid democrats that would have been supportive of the president's healthcare plan. >> this comes from a provisionthat defines a full-time employee as someone who works more than 30 hours a week. i talked to the head of restaurant companies. i have got a lot of single moms who need 30-34 hours a week plus tips to make ends meet. we are putting in place a system so they don't get any more than 30 hours a week. the teamsters, the food workers and culinary and hotel people. what these union heads are seeing, the companies that employ their members are saying we are only going to allow you to have 30 hours. you get 30 hours in my restaurant, you will have to go to place else and find another 4-5 hours and tips to make ends meet. that will be a big impact on those individuals. martha: thank you very much. we'll see you later. bill: we are going to get morereaction to what happened saturday night and what goes forward. the jurors in the george zimmerman trial making an important decision after the verdict. will they talk? will they be forced to. hey, the new guy is loaded with protein! really? 25 grams of protein. what do we have? all four of us, together? 24. he's low fat, too, and has 5 grams of sugars. i'll believe it when i--- [ both ] oooooh... what's shakin'?

if the royal heir will be a he or she. but we do know who will deliver the royal heir to the throne. he's 70 years old. he treated the duchess of cambridge for that nasty bout of morning sickness. he was set to retire. now he's joking that he won't beable until they have had baby number two or three. bill: the jurors in the george zimmerman case have spoken iing they will not speak. but the judge might overturn all of this. good morning to you. a very busy two months and i think you have been excellent on this case the entire time. thank you of being of steady mind as we try to work our way through this. the jurors don't want to talk. >> this is a tense situation. there is a lot of divisiveness in this case. and i can see why they don't want to be the target of ninls anger. bill: the identities of the jurors have not been revealed. could the judge change it? >> the judge can change the.sealing court records is the exception. typically our court records are public. so the judge has to have a legitimate basis in the law to go ahead and seal court record. i think this is a great idea to seal the names and identities of jurors. i think the legislature should make that private except for investigations. we are now in a different age. remember the casey anthony case. i can't think of anything worse than for the jurors to be hounded by the media. we ask jurors to do a difficult job and the last thing we want is for people to say i don't want to be on the jury because i don't want to be vicinity criticized later. you will and up with jurors who just want to sell a book and you will end up with verdicts thatare controversial. bill: so far we don't think any law has been violated. mark o'mara held a press conference. the state went first. long before we heard from trayvon martin's family and his parents who decided to not be in the courtroom when the verdict was announced. on the issue of race and media this is what mark o'mara talked about. >> if people would have taken a little bit of time found out how it was they were condemning it would never have happened. fit certainly wouldn't have happened if he was black because those people who decided they were going to make him the scapegoat would noto not have. bill: sensitive topic.how did he manage it? >> i think he did very well. he makes a valid point. i don't have zero problem. i would encourage for the investigators to look into racism as a motive. the young black male unarmed shot and killed by a white male. if that doesn't pop into your mind, you are ignoring the reality of racism. once you do the investigation you realize it was overwhelming evidence george zimmerman was not a racist, you have to move on from that. the media really in many respects didn't seem to move on from that and in some ways encouraged it. one of the major networks edited the police call to make it sound like he was racially profiling. bill: oftentimes we forget about that because it happened more than a year ago. what did you think about the state attorneys saturday night and their full-throated defense of their case. instead of coming out and sayingthe jurors have spoken they went on and on and on. what was your view of the reaction? >> i was surprised. i have seen many public speeches by prosecutors after they win or lose a case and usually if they lose a case they say we disagree with the verdict but we respect the jury's decision and we ask everybody to maintain calm. bill: why did they tawct way they did? >> i don't know. but to me it seemed like they were defending their case all over again. there has been a lot of criticism rightfully so about them bringing this case when they knew they didn't have enough evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. i think they probably mow that even investigation is going to be launched to look into this. billthis.to find out if there was political motor vision to bring this case. it was an investigation thatbeneath needed to investigated full bore. but oftentimes prosecutors realize we don't have evidence to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt and they have a difficult conversation with the family and i we don't have it. bill: there could be an investigation as to why they brought charges in the first place? >> there are pending allegations about hiding discovery. the motion of contempt that was continued to the end of the case. there is some pretty interesting evidence that the state attorney's office may have been hiding evidence from the defense. that's a huge ethical and moral ocial nation they have to abide by and it appears that could cause disbarment in some cases. if that is happening and you look at other pieces of the way they investigated this case, and the playing of the audiotape in front of entire family members instead of one at a time. it screams of an agenda.they stood there and retried the case. bill: we'll see if eric holder makes a move. that's something to watch. judge, alex, thank you. we'll go back to martha in london. martha: scorching heat. how long will these punishing temperatures be around? it' hot here, too. look at that heat index. plus edward snowden holding more vital information. what could this new leak be about? >> the moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us has been costly, but it was the right thing to do and i have no regrets.bill: the show will go on. cirque du soleil will go on after the death of a performer about a month ago. the new show will not include that final scene anymore. it will be dedicated to the memory of the acrobat who died. martha: with a new way to raise money, even millions of dollars and it's all done with social media. how does it work, william? >> reporter: it's like begging on the internet. you have a great idea but you are broke. imagine raising $million bucks with total strangers giving you $10 or $20. >> i was so nervous. the money was just rolling in. >> we were watching it closely and it was like an atm machine.film makers wanted to make a documentary about crowd funding. >> if you have an idea anybody can fund it themselves. you * but a month ago they ran out of money. >> we have taken it as far as we could with our own resources. >> reporter: they turned to kickstarter to raise the $80,000. >> you are opening every bit of social kinds of value and equities you are putting on the line. >> we felt it made a lot of sense to crowd found the movie about crowd turning. >> we are at $74,000 and we have 12 hours to go. >> you are bringing people deeper into the experience andthey become your biggest fans. >> here is where we need your help ... >> reporter: from food trucks to dance troupes to solar vehicles. most crowd funding campaigns involve social issues. jay and jason did reach their goal, their movie cop out in about a year. martha: great story. thank you. >> there is more reaction. the mainstream media coming up fire for how they fire it from zimmerman's own lawyer's review. >> the 17-year-old thought that he had to lash out and attack violently. and it turned out that all of the forensic evidence supports that. none of it supports that george was ever the aggressor, not legally and i don't believe morally. members of the american postal worker's unionhandle more than 165 billion letters and packages a year. that's about 34

first broke the story is saying that edward snowden has a lot more data that could be even more damaging to u.s. security. welcome, everybody to a brand-new hour of ""america's newsroom."" i'm martha mccallum live in london as people wait for the birth of the baby heir. bill: glenn greenwald says snowden has information on how the nsa is structured and how it operates. he's in possession of literally thousands of document that contain very specific blueprints that would allow somebody who read them to know exactly howthe nsa does what it does. which would in turn allow them to evade that surveillance or replicate it. martha: this comes days after snowden met with russian politicians and human rights groups to ask for their help in getting to south america. >> i ask for your assistance in requesting safe passage to latin america as well as requesting asylum in russia until such time at these states acede to law and my legal travel is permitted. >> reporter: ""the guardian"" journalist says edward snowden has thousands of document that amount to an instruction manual on how the nsa is built.his application for asylum to several latin american company in limbo because his u.s. passport has been suspended. officials in russia say they have yet to receive an official application from snowden. green wald says the document in snowden's possession would be harmful to the nsa but would not endanger americans. >> there are other document that have been revealed similar in nature. we are working on some of those. also being able to inform people about the true severity of how each nsa analyst has access to people's personal and private information without safeguards.>> reporter: greenwald says snowden remains calm and trin quill and has no regrets about what he has done. the document will be transferred to others if snowden is harmed. martha: snowden flew from hong kong to th to the moscow airpor. july 2 wikileaks says snowden applied for asylum in 21 countries and received 12 rejections. two days later icelandic you a makers voted to provide immediate citizenship to him. venezuela and nicaragua saidthey would grant him asylum. and he said he will stop leaking documents if russia will give him asylum them can move on to latin america. bill: back in this country. a fox news extreme weather alert. man, it's hot out there. mid-july, here comes the heat. the temperature is already about 90 degree at 10:00 in the morning. heat advisories in effect for major cities across the region. maria molina will have a long week near the extreme weather center. >> reporter: many areas in the northeast, big cities like washington, d.c., envelope, new york city, up into the city of boston we'll be looking at hot temperatures not just today, not just tomorrow, but through the even of the workweek through friday. looking at a prolonged period oftime. we could be looking at heat index values near 100 degree as you head into areas further inland. just west of the of the i95 cor. here is a look at some of the expected heat index values. it will feel like 101 in philadelphia. it will feel like 100 in new york city. when you are walk on the

washington, d.c. it's only 10-06 in the morning. it's going stay hot out here. as we head farther west, i want to show the disparity. when you think of hot temperatures you think of state like new mexico. you think of oklahoma, texas. take a look at the high temperature in the city of dallas. only 78. only 76 in albuquerque. very weird. bill: we have been waiting for summer for a month and a half. thank you, maria. there will be concerns for health out there for the pets and the seniors. the body normally cools itself by sweating but in some cases and some conditions sweating is not enough. high body temperatures can damage the brain or other vitalorgans and those most at risk include the young, children up to 4 years old and the elderly. and those who are overweight or ill or on certain medications. be careful during the heat. martha: here we have not escaped the heat either. the united kingdom has temperatures hovering in the mid to upper 80s. drivers faced major delays after part of the m25 melted and had to be closed off. that stretch reopened after emergency surfacing. the current heat wave could continue for at least another week. sad news, they lost two soldiers in a military training exercise here due to the heat. that was one of the big headlines this morning out there. of course on the royal baby front, no woman like to be pregnant in the middle of a heatwave. i have don't myself. it's not that much fun. so they are waiting for relief in the u.k. as well. >> the hot temperatures will be sticking around through another week. the areas in the u.k. not used to dealing with hot temperatures like this. so many people without air-conditioning. we had fatality, and travel delays. and heat is one of the top weather-related killers. that's something for everyone to keep in mind. have fun, head to the beaches, stay hydrated. martha: we have new reaction from washington following this weekend's verdict in the george zimmerman murder trial. kelly wright is live in our d.c. bureau. >> reporter: among members of congress there is no shortage of responses or reaction to the acquittal of george zimmerman.lawmakers accept the verdict as a matter of law. they understand why the 6 women jurors found zimmerman not guilty of shooting 17-year-old trayvon martin. >> the evidence didn't support prosecution. the justice department and the president engaged in this and turn it into a political issue. >> no matter where you stand, it's a tragedy for a young man who was killed. it's a tragedy for a wrong man who killed and mr. carry it around with him the rest of his life. we need to come together as a nation of laws, of courts and of civil rights. >> reporter: senate majority leader harry reid says the case is not over. he says it doesn't end with the jury trial. >> it doesn't end with the jury trial. there is the justice department looking at this and maybe the state of florida will take a look at this outland dish lawthey have that allows people to track people down and a self-defenses claim was brought to a point where they should take a hard look at it. >> reporter: he's talking about the stand your ground law and he says that's something florida will be looking into. martha: what is the reaction from president obama? >> reporter: the president issued statement and he said the death of trayvon martin was a tragedy not just for his family or for any one community. but for america. he goes on to say i know his case has elicited strong passions and in the wake of the verdict i know the passions are running higher but we are a nation of laws and the jury has spoken. we should ask ourselves as individual and as a society how we can prevent future tragedies like this. that's the way to honor trayvonmartin he says. bill: we'll have more on this. reporters under fire for how they covered the george zimmerman murder trial. >> guys, the media, he was like a patient in an operating table where a mad scientist were committing experiments on him and he had no anesthesia. bill: did the media damage the defendant's reputation? bill: the bulls are off, 13 points to the up side. the reason why that could be significant. we have seen 25 record closes in 2013. we'll found out whether today is another record. critics call the white house foreign policy muddled and looking a leader. fair and balanced debate on whether the u.s. can still lead. >> when we are telling others how to run their countries, what do other countries think of a model we are currently presenting? i think america is the greatestcountry in the world. but convincing others of that is probably a harder sell. the great outdoors......and a great deal. thanks to dad. nope eeeeh... oh, guys let's leave the deals to

>> george zimmerman largely damaged his own rep days. even though he got a fair trial and the prosecution did not profits case beyond a reasonable doubt. many people upset about the possible sect of somebody walking free after shooting an unarmed black teenager. mostly my problem is with the commentary.it was the fact that we didn't have zimmerman's side. we mostly had the pair bones facts of the case which is martin was coming back from the store with a bag of candy and we didn't know the details of the altercation. >> you have to go back to the nbc issue where they edited his words to make it sound as if he said there is a guy out here up to no good and he's black when in fact he was asked that question. do you see what color this young man is, is he white, hispanic or black and that's when he said he's black. did that set things off on the wrong foot? >> nbc's misleading editing of that 911 tape was a horrible blirnl -- ahorrible blunder ande other mistakes along the way. but the way which the media haveacted as a megaphone or ugly and raigly inflammatory comments, not just from people who are involved in the case, but commentators themselves. al sharpton on msnbc who has participated in demonstrations and advised trayvon martin's family and uses his table show as a platform to crusade against george zimmerman. he says this was an atrocity and a slap in the face to those who believe in justice. he stead this puts every child at risk. we don't need to take this one case as sad and tragic as it is and extrapolate from that that it's open season on blacks. martha: you add the social media to that cocktail and celebrity weighing in on this in a way that you never used to be ableto before. and that's potent mix. >> twitter is a great resource before it has its dark side. a lot of ordinary people tweeting what i believe to be racist comments. one of them is michael moore. who wrote had a gun-toting martin who stalked zirm man, do i need to complete this sentence? whatever the strong feelings about this case. i understand people people emotion alley on both sides. you also have ann coulter saying hallelujah, celebrating the fact that george zimmerman was acquitted. comment like these are helping to inflame the situation.there was a lot of chatter that there might be violence if george zimmerman was found not guilty. that largely has not been the case. i'm glad some of the media commend day towards were wrong about that one. martha: you spent so many years weighing in on how the media is doing. and being a mirror for the media. given the fact that twitter is such a large kind of organ in all of these discussions now, is it even more incumbent than ever upon the media to treat situations like this fairly and how would you grade most of the media on how they did in that record? >> i would say the media seized this case which didn't get any national case in the beginning until activists portrayed it as a racial outrage. there was too much exploiting this one tragic killing or ratings and circulation andclicks and we saw that with the wall to wall coverage on some major networks of this trial. as far as twitter, people get to say what they feel. but celebrities have handlers who have can intervene before they say something stupid. martha: then we go through the move of having to take it off and a90s's taken off. very interesting. howard, welcome. once again, great to have a dialogue with you on fox and to have you as part of the group. thank you so much. see you soon. bill will b.bill: careful what , howard. lawmakers say this stunt needs to end.at a dry cleaner, we replaced people with a machine. what? customers didn't like it. so why do banks do it? hello? hello?! if your bank doesn't let you talk to a real person 24/7, you need an ally. hello? ally bank. your money needs an ally.backflips and cartwheels.mile? love, warmth. here, try this. backflips and camm, ok!s.mile? ching! i like the fact that there's lots of different tastes going on. mmmm! breakfast i'm very impressed. this is a great cereal! honey bunches of oats. i hear you crunching. man: the charcoal went out already? ... forget it. vo: there's more barbeque time in every bag of kingsford original charcoal. kingsford. slow down and grill.martha: awesome story from over the weekend. an autopsy being performed today on the ""glee"" actor. no sign of foul play, but hit a history of drug addiction. most recently check into rehab in early march. he had been out with friends the night before his body was found. more on that when we get it. bill: a fox news alert on the internal government. after this ousting of mohammed morsi in egypt. an update now.an update now. the supporters are continually protesting, demanding his release, but egypt is starting fast the way it was. the country still has deep economic and political problems but it is no longer at a standstill because of the daily protest. the transitional government is beginning to take shape and expecting a full cap next in the next few days or so. elections to be held in the next six months or so. economy is the big issue and the big challenge here. they will not continue negotiating a loan with the federal imf. they have pledged billions of dollars in aid. also, the u.s. deputy secretary of state arrived today meeting with top egyptian officials about the transition to democracy, to discuss the aid given to the egyptian military and the government.now despite the military coup, the u.s. is unlikely to cut off aid to the military. they want to see a quick transition to democracy rather than cutting off aid to the military as is required by u.s. law. bill: things, live in cairo, egypt. back to london now. martha: bob schieffer rips into lawmakers, what he says they are setting a bad example for the rest of the world. bill: a six-year-old boy buried under 11 feet of sand, how he is doing now and what rescuers say about how they helped this young boy survived. >> you are holding this child who you think is lifeless, it is hard to deal with. >> they are crying all over the place.try to just stay focused and the first two hours was completely misery. you want to see something cool? snapshot, from progressive. my insurance company told me not to talk to people like you. you always do what they tell you? no... try it, and see what your good driving can save you. you don't even have to switch. unless you're scared. i'm not scared, it's... you know we can still see you. no, you can't. pretty sure we can... try snapshot today -- no pressure.in cities like charlotte,ing. atlanta, and chicago, we're revving people up to take a lap around the legendary nascar race track with drivers from the coca-cola racing family. coca-coca family track walks give thousands of race fans the chance to get out, get moving, and have fun... all along the way. it's part of our goal to inspire more than three million people to rediscover the joy of being active this summer. see the difference all of us can make... together. bill: new questions of americans standing when bob schieffer ripped into the u.s. government saying the inability to get things done in washington said a bad example for the rest of the world. >> america has always led to this when we led by example.a growing list of things washington has made a mess of lately. the great reform, food stamps, farm aid, student loans, deficit reduction, a tax system regardless of the fairness or unfairness, so complex nobody can understand it. a health care plan administration cannot figure out how to administer. an airport where one third are grounded because congress can't figure out how to fund it. i have to wonder who would want to be like that. bill: welcome. welcome to both of you. >> good morning. bill: lead by example, so what did you think of the points bob schieffer was making? >> we have been declining in the world's eyes for some time, didn't just start with barack obama.although he did say he was going to restore our position in the world, and i don't think that has been the case. a lot of the criticism has to do with foreign policy rather than the things he brought out. bill: will take that initial point. what did you think of the comment leading by example? >> examples where measured by our things we do over there, not what we do over here, necessarily. the reason we have a national debt approaching the same level they have an economic system in europe, the military spending have seen. the hapless policy of sin, but you haven't seen for this administration in the middle east, tunisia, egypt, libya, iran, looking at us to say i would better with president obama then george w. bush? at least he had some sense ofconsistency where america now has played an absurd leadership to europe and i don't even think the europeans have like that. bill: how great is it to have tony say you are exactly right? >> we may describe bit on this. the afghanistan war, people in pakistan, it does not really cause a lot of goodwill for us in the middle east. i don't know anybody in the middle east who likes george bush, so don't a basic and back and saying it was great under george bush and now it is bad under obama. bill: he seems to be pretty fair and balanced on this. he has strong words against the administration, strong words against the congress, basically saying get it done. >> lets face it, this is bob schieffer. basically the canary in the coalmine the fact there is equal blame his eyes to congress and the president he is admitting the president failed to achieve somehow rebranded the american image of the world stage, reconstruct our relationship with european allies and the arab world. we have a lower standing among muslims in the world than we did when george w. bush was president. probably due in part to the fact president obama has talked a good game, what is one of the biggest criticisms? he considered the drone strikes, nsa programs that were so bad under george w. bush, so has not done anything really. bill: i am seeing the 100-yard stare right now. >> he just brought up a good point, nsa program harming the view of people around the world, a lot of criticism in europe. i don't think this reflects well on the united states or onbarack obama not just spying on americans but people don't like the idea the feels he can spy on them. bill: he concluded by saying america is the greatest country in the world but convincing others of that is probably a harder sell than it used to be. >> you know it sells is our dominance. while he is right where losing standing and still the greatest nation the problem has been the fact we have not had the doctrine by democrats and republicans has maintained and preserved us. look at russia with edward snowden. bill: thank you. ♪ martha: thousands gather for a public memorial service honoring one of the 19 elite firefighters killed in that horrific fire in arizona.30-year-old actor for mackenzie died while battling a massive wildfire outside of your now. there's a look at the service and the servicemen and women standing in attention. they said he had a gift for making everybody stay a little bit brighter. >> and exuberance for life, if you want to call it that, taken any moment and turning it into a good thing. >> he never gave up, he never gave in, not once did he quit. >> see you on the fire line, brother. martha: he works the san bernardino fire department. bill: we remember all of them. at 22 minutes before the hour, credible story of survival, a boy buried alive under 11 feet of sand. how is he doing today?we will tell you. martha: international media is swarming outside the hospital where the duchess of cambridge is expected to give birth any day to future king or queen of england. hey! did you know that honey nut cheerioshas oats that can help lower cholesterol? and it tastes good? sure does! wow. it's the honey, it makes it taste so... well, would you look at the time... what's the rush? be happy. be healthy.bill: an eight-year-old boy buried alive under sand in critical condition. he was swallowed up in a massive dune friday night in the rescue crews spent three hours before he was rescued. >> before we pulled him out, it really didn't look good. that could be your kid orwhatever, so we were going to treat him the matter what. it went from a very grave situation to it couldn't have worked any better. >> he is extraordinary. he went through a lot. bill: indeed he did. the little boy was only able to survive because of an air pocket that allowed him to breathe under all that sand. martha: what a story. back here in london, we are awaiting the birth of the royal baby of course i and a live look outside where a very pregnant duchess of cambridge is expected to give birth any day now. nobody knows for sure connectivity will begin around the hospital but the father to be prince william very calm and relaxed yesterday, and why not. he was 100 miles away in a charity polo match. it was happily encouraged to goabout his schedule as usual. joining us now. good to have you with us today. everybody is speculating about when the big day might be. >> watch william, he will absolutely want to be by kate's side. he has taken the next few days off. interestingly, camilla was born on july 172 is a chance diana's first grand child could share a birthday with camilla. martha: when you take a look at the plan, that is the window weighing at the hospital. when prince william was presented by his parentsprincess diana and his father, prince charles, this is the exact same spot this baby presented to the public as well. >> they us used to stay in royal residency so the queen had all the babies at home. treated until 1982. diane i wasn't having any of that, wasn't in the wing, taking every single precaution they can to have a very safe delivery. martha: charles was in the delivery room which also broke tradition. everybody is agreeing that is exactly where williams wants to be as well. keep an eye on william. there's a helicopter if necessary to bring him here, butit sounds like his staying pretty close for the next few days. >> we will not see kate until she goes on to the set with the baby. there are three side entrances, she used one of those last week and avoided the press and went into one of her final checkups. it is a great big watch. the press are getting very bored and some of the tweets are hysterically funny. martha: may have been there since july 8, many of them. a couple of side entrances so most likely swept into one of those, he may get some indication if you see the family members arriving at the hospital, but as i understand we will be notified and word will leak out. as soon as she is inside the hospital.>> we then have to wait, the birth will not be announced on twitter. william one form the queen on an encrypted phone and we'll have to wait for proclamation from a piece of paper outside of buckingham palace. it will have a 41 gun salute. basically invented the nation. it is a state event. martha: it has been around for a long time, this child will be one of the errors in line down one more notch. thank you so much, thank you for being with us. >> thank you for having me. bill: david beckham says it is okay they want to name their new child ""david."" martha: david is not on theshortlist but nice of him to offer up his name. bill: i thought it was most gracious. martha: i'm going to bet on george, possibly charles. george is very high in the rankings if it is a boy. bill: and a girl? >> most likely alexandra or mary or elizabeth or possibly charlotte. bill: we're on baby watch officially. you may be there for a month, so the pubs are open, go and enjoy. find out what is bringing george herbert walker bush back to the oval office. we will have that for you. why some say it is just a stunt from the government. the great outdoors, and a great deal.grrrr ahhh let's leave the deals to hotels.com. perfect! yep, and no angry bears. up to 30% off. only at hotels.com.martha: presidents past and present coming together for volunteerism. george h dubya bush joined president barack obama at the white house today for ceremony recognizing points of light. for president greeted the volunteer program 20 years ago and based their money will include the presentation of the 5000 daily points of life award. bill: unusually quiet over the weekend with the new angels grounded due to budget cuts and sequestration. there is a cancellation of the blue angels season is not only painful for pensacola but symbolic of government that has its priorities out of order. senior economic writer, good morning to you.he is hot and fire on this but it seems you can take the blue angels, think of the cutbacks for the blue angels, really makes this bigger in terms of the symbolism for how the federal government made the cut and where. >> remember, we have had some scandals with respect to how the sequester has been handled over the past three months. white house tourism office being closed down, a few days of the air traffic control system being grounded to a halt and some of the national parks being intercepted the mac shutdown. this is the latest in the outrageous. i look at the budget for the blue angels. about $40 million program. that is a tiny fraction obviously have claimed was per year pentagon budget.i have a soft place in my heart the blue angels every year. it is a glorious day. both a lot of support for the military. very short siding. bill: less than 1% of the total cut made to the navy's operating budget in 2013 budget year. >> my point is and i think senator rubio agrees with this you are cutting one of the most high profile, popular items of the military, everybody loves to go see the blue angels and the dedication to the great military prowess behalf in this country. i find it to be somewhat of kind of a ploy stunt if you will by the obama administration to again bring pressure on congress to stop the sequester.here is the point, i am very pro-national defense but there is a lot of waste in the pentagon. one of the biggest directors fees, they could be cutting some of the bureaucracies. bill: you don't have enough priorities. >> something very popular with the public, so many ways to cut billions of dollars of waste in the pentagon. bill: talk about cutting a complex in afghanistan. one more point, in the last hour alone we were told the thunderbirds based out of virginia, did you see that story? >> that made my story because i love the thunderbirds part of the exhibit all over the country. they fly over new york city and it is a wonderful thing and they get i think it is somethingamericans like to see how the tax dollars are being spent. bill: we will see whether or not the blue angels can get their way and pensacola. martha: one of them may have helped us get our start. thank you, steve. you followed this morning with the recent threat to invoke the so-called nuclear option in order to push stalled presidential appointees through. what could end up spelling big trouble. all business purchases.so you can capture your receipts, and manage them online with jot, the latest app from ink. so you can spend less time doing paperwork. and more time doing paperwork. ink from cha. so you can.martha, you know, bill, it is a strange enough experience to have your first child.i only imagine what it is like to do with entire world media outside the door. but somewhere, not too far from here, that is a little bit of what kate must be feeling at this hour. so she waits, and we wait and you watch. >> i imagine the whole country is jacked up for this. what is your sense? what are you feeling? >> oh, definitely, it is everywhere. they love a party and good reason to celebrate. they have been on a roll with jubilee and the olympics. this is one more thing for great britain to be excited about. they're pumped. >> nicely done, martha. you look great. >> welcome back. >> it is great to be back. we go on baby watch. it could happen at anytime. all right, martha. see you tomorrow. we got to run. >> see you buddy. >> ""happening now"" starts right now. jenna: we'll stay on baby watch but right now we have brand new stories and other breaking news today. jon: a heat dome blanketing tens"

moments ago police in washington state releasing surveillance video surveillance photos of two suspects in the fate beating of a world war ii veteran who was wounded in the battle of okinawa. the murder victim, 88-year-old delbert boughton, spokane washington police say two teens beat him to death last night. they attacked him in a parking lot of an ice arena. officers found the victim in his car. he had serious head injuries and later died. police are now looking for two suspects. anyone with information on this crime is asked to call police. we're going to bring you more on this breaking news story as we get it.   right now, another unthinkable crime. >> one of the perps claims to have knocked out five white people since the zimmerman trial. very happy and proud about it. same guy claims that 90% ofwhites are nasty, and he hates them. but it is your host, rush limbaugh, who injected race into this story. >> i can tell you what one of them have said, the one that is talking said, we were bored. we wanted something to do. we wanted to kill somebody. >> we saw in social media allegedly linked to one of these suspects where he's saying, come get me. i don't care. i'm not afraid to die. >> james edward jr. the 15-year-old months ago on what is believed to be his twitter account. he posted this. the message was ""90% of white people are nasty. #hatethem."" >> why does the left protect racism? they're doing so here in the killing of this australian college student. >> i'm going to do everything they can to ensure that we see these three thugs pay for what they did to christopher lane. >> prosecutors planning to do next, stephens county district attorney jason hicks joins us.good evening, sir. >> good evening, greta. >> two of the men in this charged with first degree murder and the other one, the driver, is an accessory after the fact in another related charge. can you tell me why the driver has a lesser offense when he was in the car? and i assume that the passengers charged as an aider and abetter to the triggerman. why isn't the driver? >> i can't get into a lot of detail with respect to why the driver is only using those words only charged with a lesser crime except to say what has been presented to us the charges are appropriate for this particular situation. and as i talked in open court tuesday and pointed out to the judge in my request to deny bond for edwards and -- well, to deny for the two charged with murder in the first degree, what we ended up with there was a situation where i told the court that those two absolutely hadnothing to do with law enforcement. they didn't want to talk, they didn't want to cooperate. they had nothing to do. and at that time, jones gave us some information that we needed. >> we're hearing that james edwards, which is the passenger of the car that he had a twitter account with rather disturbing tweets. have you had occasion to look at that? >> i have not seen everything that has come off of edwards' twitter account. i've been made aware there were some statements that he made that were derogatory -- that would have been racial comments that were made. but based upon all the evidence that i have inside my file at this time, all the videos, the police reports and what not, i don't have anything in there indicate that the killing of christopher lane was related to either his race or to his nationality. >> apparently one of them is speaking. we understand that to be jones, the driver. and is he the one who said thatthey were just wobored and lookg for something to do? >> that would be correct. >> and what was sort of the followup on that? i guess that they were aghast at hearing that. any followup things he said after that? >> i don't want to get into too much detail as to what he said. because at some point these three are going to have to go to trial. but in followup, we're still visiting with that particular defendant at this time trying to pin down exactly the motive and what not behind this particular crime. >> after the shooting, they fled. how was it that you were led to them? >> we were led to them -- they fled. they went west from the murder scene to a hotel and restaurant. there's approximately a mile from the scene of the shooting. stayed behind a hotel for approximately 11 or 12 minutes at which time it's our understanding they hid the murder weapon inside acompartment of the hood in the vehicle, fled the scene, and then they took edwards to the stephens county courthouse where he had an appointment with the office of juvenile affairs. had to sign off on a probation agreement. >> edwards is not new to the criminal justice department if he's got to sign off on probation. >> no. >> is that the point at which they were arrested? >> no. from there we would have to roll forward approximately three, maybe four hours. we get a call that came into the 911 center in duncan reporting three suspicious individuals in a black car across the street from one of the local churches. law enforcement agents went to that particular scene and put two and two together and realized that this black ford focus that they were in was the black ford focus that was tied into the murder earlier in the day. good police work is what it was. >> any resistance to being arrested when the police pulledup on them? >> no. there was no resistance to an arrest. >> have you had -- people don't realize that one of the toughest parts about being a prosecutor is that you often at some point you talk to the victim's family. that's tough. that's hard. and i realize that they live in australia. but have you had any contact so far with them? >> it's a very difficult conversation to have with the victim's family. i have visited with the girlfriend with the harper family inside duncan. i have not visited with the lane family in australia. but we'll be doing that within the next i'll say week to two weeks. >> what do you say to them? >> i don't know that there's anything they can say to them. i certainly can't do anything to bring their child back. he was sent over here to do nothing more than to seek an education and to better himself. all i can do is apologize for their loss, apologize to the australian community for such a tragic accident. because this isn't reflective ofour society. it's not reflective of duncan, oklahoma. it's not reflective of stephens county, oklahoma. and express to them that i'm going to do everything that i can, everything within my power to ensure that these three thugs pay for exactly what they did to their son. >> looking at your docket, i know you have some feel for your docket when cases get tried or not. i know you can't tell us with certainty but you have some sort of idea. when would be your wild guess this would get to trial, assuming it doesn't have some sort of plea agreement? >> i think with the best case scenario, i'm going to say it's probably going to be 12 months. it's probably more realistically going to be 18 to 24 months before this actually makes it onto a trial docket. >> some jurisdictions it takes forever to try a case once they get into trial. california is the reference point. i'm curious how long would you -- i know you don't know what the defenses are. i know this is still early. but typically a trial like this lasts about how long in trial in oklahoma?>> we anticipate this lasting anywhere from one, one and a half to two weeks. it shouldn't take us more than two weeks to have it tried. >> and the next court appearance is early october? is that correct? >> that is correct. the jones is scheduled for -- actually scheduled for a preliminary hearing in early october. luna edwards are both scheduled for preliminary conferences in early october. >> will they not be tried together? i assume the defense attorney is going to try to separate them, but don't you expect -- how come the preliminary hearings aren't sort of joined together? >> there will be motions filed requesting the court hear the preliminary hearings together. jones's preliminary hearing will be heard separate from the other two simply because he's in what is referred to as the youthful offender system here in oklahoma. but when it comes time for trial, there'll be motions filed and requests made that the court hear all of it together for judicial expediency and other reasons. that will be a decision made down the road. my preference would be try them all together. >> and defense wants to try themseparately. you say that jones is a youthful offender. he's actual lit oldest of the three. is that because he has a lesser charge that's allowed to be considered a youthful offender? >> yes. it's because he's charged under oklahoma statute with a drive-by shooting statute. that's a youthful offender offense in the state of oklahoma. then he's also charged with accessory after the fact. and for all intents and purposes he's being treated as an adult. we will have to file a motion to impose an adult sentence on him. that will be done in the very near future. >> but he can still be tried together with them even if he's a youthful offender? >> yes, he could. >> district attorney, thank you very much, sir. >> thank you, greta.   and now to some very disturbing tweets boy one of the murder suspects. fox news correspondent garrett tenney is live with the latest. tell me about these tweets. >> they actually are very disturbing.these two tweets that we're going to to show you here are both from james edwards jr., here is the youngest of these three teens that were involved in this case. this tweet was a few months ago. he allegedly posted this. ""90% of white people are nasty. #hatethem. then in another post just a few days after the trial of george zimmerman, there was this message where using slang he bragged about knocking out five white people since the verdict was read. we spoke to the district attorney earlier today as well. and he said that right now they are not focusing on the murder as a hate crime, and instead is a homicide, though. and meanwhile, a private memorial service has been scheduled for christopher lane on saturday afternoon at oklahoma christian university. that's the university where his girlfriend attends. and organizers are planning to have all who attend write down memories of lane to send to his parents in australia. and earlier this week, a formerteammate of the collegiate baseball player started an online fundraiser to cover all of the expenses that it would take for lane's family to fly to oklahoma to retrieve their son's body and return it back home to australia. and as of just a few minutes ago, more than $106,000 in donations have poured in for the trip and to establish a memorial in his name. greta? >> garrett, what's the level of certainty that this twitter account is that of the defendant, number one? and number two, if it is his twitter account what's the level of certainty he's the one who actually did the tweeting? >> those are always the big questions when you are trying to verify the twitter account. they do have some profiles that of course have verified. and those are usually celebrities and big known people. but he was not one of those. we are able to look at the tweets and be able to look at different things we know. for instance, a court appearance that he had. he was tweeting there on that account. or whoever was was tweeting about a court appearance going to see the judge.we do know that edwards was scheduled to be in court at that same time that day. so we do have that go off of. but twitter accounts you can never be absolutely certain of that. police of course have not said at this time whether for sure or not that is had is. >> certainly stunning things that at least one of them is accused of saying. of course now we're all referring to this as a thrill kill. but is there any -- i guess there's nothing to sort of mitigate against that. so far no evidence has come up to at least make any of them look innocent or any of them to have nothing but sort malice in their heart on this. >> nothing has come up at this point. of course their family members, almost any family member would say they don't believe that these young men had anything to do with this crime. but at this time, they have said that they don't know exactly where those teens were at that time when this happened. when one of the mothers came home, the mother of luna, she said that she found her son at home and that he left shortlyagain thereafter. so there hasn't been anything to say otherwise at this time. >> garrett, thank you. >> certainly. >> 15-year-old james edwards accused of first degree murder and posting racist tweets. pastor ryan benton has known edwards for years. he joins us. good evening, sir. >> how are you doing, greta? >> very well. these tweets, have you now read them or heard of them? >> no, i haven't kept up the with any of the tweets. and just through hearing other people talk about them. but i haven't seen them myself. >> the one that james francis edwards, the young man that you know at least on his twitter account, and people believe he's the one who tweeted says ""90% of white people are nasty. #hate them."" how do you reconcile that with the young man who you know? >> well, in my profession, in what i do, i watch kids grow up. and as they grow, they start tomake decisions. and this kid as well as other kids in our community are faced with the choices of what circle of influence they're going to follow. and i've spoke time and time again to him. and i'm just one voice of many people in the community, whether it was coaches or police officers or just leaders in the community that have talked to him about using the gifts, the talents to be able to -- to be able to lead people in the right direction rather than making the choices that they sometimes make. >> well, as i understand you saw him about three weeks ago. i'm curious, based on what you just said, i take -- this is just what i'm reading into it -- that you were a little suspicious that this was a young man who was not headed in the right direction. from what you said. is that a fair description? or does this totally shock you? >> of course this shocks me.>> but i mean, was he a troubled kid is what i'm saying. is this a troubled young man that in some way you're shocked by the heinousness of the crime but not so shocked by someone maybe who his behavior as such that the writing is on the wall? >> no. i never imagined that any kid would be capable of this. and i look at this, and i have to ask myself, what would cause something like this? and there are no answers. and we're probably not going to ever know the full extent of the driving force behind it. but when i look at kids and the circle of influence that surround them, eventually they are going to start making bad choices and they will become who they hang out with. and that's what i saw of that. he had positive influences around him. and he also had a lot of negative influences around him. >> how about his family? how about his family? do you know his family at all?know his mother, father, siblings or anything? >> i know his father. >> what can you tell me about his father? >> we run at the outreach we run a free meal program. and one of the apartment complexes that we give food to children in is the apartment complex that his father i assume is employed there as a grounds keeper. but every day throughout the summer he helped make sure that the k the kids were getting the food and that they were being respectful. and throughout the past two or three years of doing free dinner programs, he's always been there to watch out for us when we came onto the property. >> let me say, do father and mother live together?

where exactly was she? >> well, i think the u.n. has spoken to this. but since you asked, ambassador power is on a prearranged trip. >> can you tell us where ambassador power was? >> she had a previously scheduled trip. i don't think i need to go into more details from here. and you're welcome to call the united nations where she's the ambassador. >> you were willing to read out a certain set of facts related to this. why do you stop at this? >> i have no more for you on this. >> the obama administration refusing to say where its new u.n. ambassador was yesterday. we know where she was not.ambassador samantha power did not attend the emergency security council meeting on syria. we contacted the u.n. and they wouldn't tell us either other than the sort of prearranged trip or whatever it is. but is up important that she wasn't at this emergency meeting on syria, or is it insignificant? >> well, i'm surprised she's on vacation, to begin with. >> so prearranged trip means vacation? >> i think that's clearly what it is. i really think it's a form of child abuse for the obama administration to put people out to have to say that sort of thing. i didn't go on vacation because -- my recess appointment started august 1st. because there's a lot of work to do before the u.n. general assembly opens in the middle of september. plus i thought i ought to try and meet every other u.n. ambassador, meeting 190 people takes some time. so i'm surprised she was on vacation. i think it does make a difference. i think the real work of the u.n. ambassador is the interaction with the otherambassadors in new york. and you can be on the phone, but if you're not in the room it doesn't make any difference. >> well france, u.k. and russia sense deputies. we sent a deputy. but maybe it's just me. i actually think if you get a job and it's something involving something so urgent as chemical weapons against another country, and she tweeted or was tweeted from her account that the u.n. needed to act fast, i would expect she would act fast. maybe it's me. >> it depends on what your priorities are. if your vacation's important. she didn't come back today either, apparently. >> unless she's like on some mountaintop and she can't get here. >> that's possible. they ought to say that if that's true. it would be better to say she's on a boat in the middle of the pacific and can't get back. that is better than trying to hide where she is in fact. but i think there's a larger issue here. the ""wall street journal"" has a fascinating editorial out tonight. it will be in the paper tomorrow. saying that the utterfecklessness of the obama administration's policy ought to cause somebody to resign to assert principle over power. they suggest it might be ambassador power. i don't think she's going to do it. but it's a very interesting point. >> i don't get this. we said a red line. we've passed that red line. we can say whatever that we didn't really pass it but we did pass it. we can say it wasn't a military coup in egypt. it was. we've got very important things going on and everyone taking vacations. maybe they're entitled by law. everybody says i can do the job. she tweets this is extremely important the u.n. acts fast and she's not there. >> well, if your policy is in such disarray as the obama administration's policy is across the board, tweeting is probably the best they can do. and that's what the problem is. honestly at the end of the day it's not whether samantha power is in new york or not. that's enough of an embarrassment. maybe the best thing is to stay away from the scene of the embarrassment. it's the policy itself that's failed. the president never should have drawn the red line unless he intended to do something aboutit. i happen to think we don't have any business intervening military. but i tell you this, when the president of the united states makes a commitment and then fails to live up to it, it damages the united states across the board. not just in syria, across the board. and the president has done that again and again. in syria, in benghazi. we're almost a year since the can i killing of the ambassador. what have we done? we've got a sealed indictment. that really deters the terrorists, doesn't it? >> i want to call out france, u.k. and russia. they should have had their ambassadors there as well, too. ambassador, thank you, sir. >> thank you.   this is a fox news alert. we have new information on the breaking news we reported earlier. police looking for two suspects in the fatal beating of a world war ii veteran. reporter dillon wallenhouse joins us. what's the latest? >> reporter: good evening. the latest is that police are still looking for these two suspects. they have a description, briefdescription. two blackmales, teens. don't know what the motive is. police haven't told us much as far as a motive. it seems to be a random beating. there has been some speculation it was a possible robbery. but as you mentioned, this is an 88-year-old world war ii veteran. he was wounded in okinawa during the war. he spent most of his life in spokane working on cars. we talked to his friends and family, obviously they're pretty shaken up about this because it appears it was just a completely random beating last night. he ended up dying in the hospital early this morning. >> all right. well, we'll be talking about this tomorrow. two black men on an elderly world war ii vet who was shot at okinawa or injured at okinawa. is there any sort of -- i mean i guess the difference between random and racially motivated. is there any piece of information that leads us in either direction? >> reporter: there isn't. and the story is young because it did happen last night.police are trying to get information out throughout the day and this morning. but there's no evidence at this point to indicate that it is racially motivated. like i said, there has been some speculation of possible robbery motive, but just kind of hammer that home, nothing at this point appears to be racially motivated. >> well, it certainly is terrible the poor man. what was he doing? does he shoot pool there or something? it's one of his hobbies? >> right. we were talking with some of his friends and the bartender at the eagles lodge there. and you know, spokane is a big veterans community. so it's a place where veterans and elderly folks go and hang out. and it was one of his hobbies. he was going up there shooting some pool that night, meeting a friend. and that's what he was doing. he was waiting in a car before he even went in to go shoot pool. and this is when it happened before you even went inside. >> thank you very much for joining us. we're going to continue to getmore information on this terrible news out of the state of washington. thanks, sir.   ambassador, before i let you go i do want to ask you one thing. we're just getting news into fox that ambassador power was on a personal trip which we assume to be vacation, that she was unable to make it to new york in time for the emergency meeting. there was no transportation option that would have gotten her into town on time, and that since the moment she learned of the attack she's been engaged with her mission. so i guess that she was unable to get back. >> the security council met again today. it's not solved by one meeting. and i think it's a question really for the white house, do they want their ambassador there or not? >> i hope that maybe she's en route now. also let's hope that france, u.k. and russia also see this as people may be dying with chemical weapons. >> not so much a priority for them though is it? >> i don't know. ambassador, thank you.   senator ted cruz has a message for conservatives. don't blink. what does he mean by that senator cruz is here next.♪ ooh, baby, baby ♪ ba-ba-ba, baby [ microwave beeps ] ♪ ooh, baby, baby ♪ ba-ba-ba, baby ♪ get up on this ♪ [ music stops ] [ man ] chef don't judge. ♪ come on, girls, let's show the guys ♪ ♪ that we know how to become number one ♪ [ male announcer ] chef boyardee microwavable cups. it's your time and your chef because...

[ cheers ] >> obamacare is the number one job killer in america. it is killing jobs. it is causing more and more people not to be hired. it is causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket. can we bring back jobs? can we stop the irs? [ crowd chanting yes, we can ] >> can we mobilize grassroots america? and can we defund obamacare? [ yes, we can ]>> senator ted cruz joins us. good evening, sir. >> good evening, greta. always good to be with you. >> nice to have you, sir. i know you've been traveling around doing town hall meetings about obamacare and defunding it. i'm curious how big the crowd are and if you can quantify the level of passion are people angry or not angry? >> well, i'll tell you. the reaction has been electric. the footage there was from dallas two nights ago. we had over 2,000 people there. and the energy and passion. i think among the american people that they understand that obamacare isn't working, that the wheels are falling off. we just learned this week that more and more companies are now dropping spousal coverage. so u.p.s. sent a letter to 18,000 employees informing them that their husbands and wives would no longer be covered by their health insurance. and of course, we all know president obama promised the american people if you like yourhealth insurance you can keep it. and yet every day that's proving less and less true. and i think the american people are ready to stop this, to stop the biggest job killer we've got in our economy. >> as i understand it, correct me if i'm wrong, the way that you seek to do it is by -- we're coming up against the end of the continuing resolution on the end of september and another -- we have to figure out what to do, whether have another continuing resolution or budget. budget's not going to happen. talking about continuing resolution. your idea is to oppose in the house and the senate but you're the minority of course in the senate. anything in a continuing resolution that funds obamacare? is that correct? >> well, what i think should happen is i think the house should pass a continuing resolution that funds the entirety of the federal government. every bit of it. except for obamacare. and that explicitly prohibits spending any money, mandatory or discretionary, on obamacare. now, the next step we know what will happen. we've seen this really before. president obama and harry reid will scream and yell why are themean nasty republicans threatening to shut down the government? and at that point, greta, we've got to do something that conservatives haven't done in a long time. we've got to stand up and win the argument. we've got to stand up and say no, we have voted to fund the government. we want to fund the government. we don't want to shut down the government. why is president obama threatening to shut down the government? president obama has already granted waivers to giant corporations. why is president obama threatening to shut down the government in order to deny those same waivers to hard-working american families? i think that's an argument we can win if only republicans can find the courage to stand up, to stand together and make it. >> all right. now as this unfolds as you say, if we do go into a shutdown we'll see the republicans say it's the democrats' fault, the democrats say the republicans. hypothetically say we go into a shutdown government. tell me how does it affect every american? how would we feel at shutdown?>> greta, we've seen partial temporary hitdowns before. in 1995, in 1995 the military continued to be paid. medicare continued, social security continued. medicaid continued, interest on the debt continued to be paid. what we saw in '95 was a partial temporary suspension of nonessential government functions. but in my view, we shouldn't shut down the government. we should stand strong and say, obamacare isn't working. it's failing. there's bipartisan agreement. and so we're not going to fund obamacare. and if president obama chooses to force a shutdown, a partial temporary shutdown, then we have to stand together and turn up the heat until the democrats listen to the american people. >> all right. when i was a kid we used to call that game of chicken to see who blinks first which is where it may get to. but tonight i'm reading a national review online that speaker boehner convened a conference call of his house republicans and that what he is thinking about doing is a short-term continuing resolutionwhich maintains the current sequester spending levels. not defunding obama care. that's in the house. how would that affect your strategy? >> you know, greta, if the forum that we have to convince people of on defunding obamacare is washington, d.c., is the closed, smoky rooms of washington, d.c., we can't win this fight. i can't win this fight. mike lee can't win this fight. no washington politician can win this fight. that's why i'm not trying to make the case in washington, d.c. i'm trying to make the case to the american people. because i think there's a new paradigm of politics where the american people are rising up. just a few weeks ago, a national web site launched don't fund it.com. in just a few weeks, nearly half a million americans have signed that web site. if we can see between now and september 30th millions of americans come together, sign the petition at don't fund it.com.call their senators, call their represe representatives. that's how we get this done. it has to come from the people. it won't come from washington. and greta, i think the american people should hold every elected official accountable, including me. and that's the only way we can get this done. >> well, it's interesting 80 out of 233 republican house members are urging the speaker to defund obamacare. that's in a letter on yesterday in favor. but the truth is that like these decisions are not generally made by the people but by your representatives. so you really have a hard road to hoe in terms of getting this if you're expecting the people to do this. >> well, the momentum is going in the right direction. so that's over 80. it used to be 60 in the house. so we're seeing the numbers increase. just today we had another senator join with us in terms of the commitment not to vote for any continuing resolution that funds obamacare. and it's driven by the people. look, the traditional washington way of decision making doesn'twork. i mean, it's what's produced 17 trillion in national debt. you don't get that without a whole lot of bipartisan cooperation. and the frustration the american people feel is that our elected leaders aren't listening to us. obamacare is the biggest job killer in the country. just yesterday i sat down at a round table in kerrville, texas with 20 small business owners. i asked them all, what are the challenges you're facing? over half of the small business owners said the biggest impediment they are facing to growth and jobs is obamacare. they talked about -- go ahead, greta. >> i was just going to -- sorry we ran out of time. i want to do one last thing. turn a slight corner this. happens to be a rather significant week in the cruz family. and in fact, we have a new member joining the education. i thought that i'd put this picture up for viewers to see. since you tweeted it, i always like to throw it out if i can, what's this all about?

i i find you in direct contempt 30 days in the county jail. >> she was taken to the turner correctional center where she has been for the past fourdays. now there is a new twist to the case and we will get to that in a moment. the actions of ms. soto clear disrespect for the judicial system now epidemic of disrespect in america. some of you agree. some of you don't. i think my case is getting stronger. we're following the terrible murder spree of los angeles police officer christopher dorner fired from his job. he has killed three innocent people in southern california. on the net? thousands of people are actually applauding dorner. calling him a hero for standing up against whatever. it simply is madness. stuff like that is happening all over cyberspace. also earlier this week we told you the new york stock exchange city public school system has changed its disciplinary code regarding cursing at a teacher. the combination of poor parenting, coward public education and no standards at all on the net have created aperfect storm of disrespect. this is going to be a major issue in the u.s.a. going forward there is entire generation of younger americans who simply don't care about tradition, about authority, about acting in an appropriate manner. these people will pay a price nor that disrespectful point of view. under the obama administration will also pay a price. we will be supporting many of those misguided young people who can't prosper in the marketplace. that's the memo. this afternoon she appeared again before the judge. ms. soto apologized to him. her attorney saying she was under the influence of drugs and her remarks were inappropriate. here is how the judge replied today. >>i think the judge watched my talking points memo earlier this week. we are thinking around the same thing there. the judge then vacated the jail sentence and if ms. soto can post $5,000 bond she can get out. joining us from los angeles, trial attorney. and from kansas city lawyer and psychologist. dr. russell, begin with you what do you think about this case in general? >> i liked it the way the judge had it, bill. consequences are key. way too many young people being spared. way too many consequences and way too many actions. really rare in life that we actually help people long-termby sparing them consequences of their actions. in fact, bill, that is much more the cause of our violence problem in our society than guns or lack of mental healthcare. >> the judge was compassionate. made his point. she served four days in jail. i would have done the same thing. you are saying dr. russell you would not have done the same thing you? would have let her stay in there for 30? >> you are really not going to bet me a dinner that this woman is going to clean up her act and not be back on drugs and back in trouble inside of a year? >> bill: as an officer of the court i think he has to show some compassion. i would have done that because the woman had no prior if the woman had a prior i would have kept her in. how do you see it. >> i say kudos to the judge. i certainly do not condone this girl's behavior. clearly she disrespected thecourt. clearly no excuse for what she did. i agree with you i agree with the judge. >> he went way too far. i appreciate the fact that he took a step back and realized that he was not doing the right thing. >> bill: what would you have given this woman if you were the judge in that courtroom and she said f you to you. >> i have been in hundreds of courtroom. >> bill: you are in the courtroom and you are the judge and she says f you that's what. >> that's criminal contempt and i would have given her an admonition and i would have warned her. >> bill: admonition. >> absolutely. >> bill: would have you yelled at her or would you have scolded her o, an admonition that's pretty frightening? i mean, come on. >> i would have certainly given her an admonition and let you know that you -- you have to give her a warning. >> bill: why? i wouldn't have given her a warning. i would have given her two weeks of community service. all right, let's get to thebigger picture here. the judge, his statement to her and, again, you know, i just have the feeling he saw my talking points memo on tuesday because that's what i'm saying the culture here for those under the age a of 30. blank you, i'm going to do what i want dr. russell, as a psychologist i'm sure you are seeing that. >> absolutely. we have way too many young people, bill. going through life thinking of themselves as something lancasterer than themselves. they are going through life thinking like it's their own personal biopic in which they're the star and everybody else is just extra. social media doesn't help. >> bill: they encourage it. >> it would be. >> bill: one-on-one thing there is no community in the social media i have got to ask you this.new york city public school system says you can say f you in the classroom in front of all of those kids not get suspended. stay in that classroom and you might get an admonition. do you think that's a good policy? that's a little bit different. we need to give more power to the teachers. we need to -- >> bill: if you were the head of the school district here in new york city. the kid curses out a teacher, you suspend the kid? >> i would suspend the kid. cursing at a teacher is not acceptable. not like throwing them into jail. bill? >> bill: you made me so happy. >> i'm glad to hear that, bill. >> bill: next on the run down, president obama wants a far, far left woman to

secretary penny billionaire heiress to the hyatt hotel. she has supported liberal causes for decades, foundation bearing the pritsker has given millions of dollars to the radical left. she has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the democratic party. this woman is off the chart left, right? >> that's one of her appeals for this administration. >> bill: let's not be cynical about it tell me what the commerce secretary does. >> the commerce secretary right now is supposed to be leading, you know, activities like creating jobs, pushing international trade. but there have been three acting secretaries of commerce during the obamaadministration only 2 confirmed secretaries of commerce. so it's it not a major priority. >> all right. but i don't think the secretary of commerce does anything certainly hasn't done much lately because there isn't one. >> bill: they don't do anything. oversight? >> it is, as you would infer, it's a little patronage. we are hearing very clearly that the president can't find anybody to take the job. i don't buy that penny is going to take this job. this is an accomplished business woman. she is an important community figure in chicago. and she has got bigger fish to fry. >> bill: she is really far left person. >> no question about it. >> bill: she is not going to look out for me or you or anybody else. she is going to push a very left wing agenda on to the commerce department. >> which is probably going to be pretty concern that the of the president himself. >> that brings back to initialcomment she doesn't care anymore. going to appoint these people. >> if he can find one. >> channeling his inner martin van buren. you know the master. king of patronage. he is channeling martin to appoint people, pay back time, right? >> absolutely. >> penny raised $745 million for him and the democratic party. that's pretty impressive. >> chair woman of the 2008 campaign. she was brilliant. she stepped back a little for 2012. >> bill: i shouldn't be worried about this? i don't want to have to demonstrate in front of the commerce department mainly because i don't even know where it. >> that would be appropriate. i want to make you a guarantee. if penny does become commerce secretary, she will not move this president any more to the left. >> bill: all right. good. i know you are going to apologize to the oil company. no truth that he was baptizedoil. >> crude oil. >> bill: once again the folks getting hosed and it's going -- why is it going up now? >> it's going up because the refineries are shutting down. >> bill: the refineries again. what happened to them? did a duck get in there? what happened? >> some of the refineries in this country are antiquated. >> bill: antiquated. >> we are getting -- it's time for maintenance. >> bill: maintenance. >> and we're getting ready to make that conversion to summer fuels. >> bill: even you are laughing. even you know what a scam this is up and down. and not much down. up and up and up and down a little. oh, there is a hamster. there is a hamster in the maintenance place. come on, dobbs. you know what a con this is. >> a con is a strong word. it's a difficult market. >> bill: difficult market. >> adapt to changing circumstances. >> such a joke. aren't you ashamed? >> we ought to go after these oil companies. and make them be accountable.>> i'm so thrilled that somebody in this country is making money. >> bill: what about the folks that don't have any money. obama is taking more of their money and now pay more at the pump. what about the folks? >> here is the real good news? these oil companies are not taking gasoline prices above the peek of last year? in fact, we are going to see on average gasoline prices as projected by the energy information agency. >> bill: yeah. >> will be below peek. >> what you are geraldo on that l.a. cop turned serial killer. will mr. geraldo rivera run for the senate from new jersey. somebody has to. and then, some

making the false accusation. and since 2008, his military career in the united states ended on february 1st, he has been building toward this volcanic explosion. so his first homicide, he pledges not

bill was flooded at talk radio 1790. everybody after giving lip service and it really was a passing reference to the horrible nature of the murder like michelle quan's homicide and the other, you know, the -- her fiance that homicide. then there is a dramatic but. but the l.a.p.d. is guilty of police brutality. but the l.a.p.d. is guilty of racism, but the man has a lot of substance read in that manifesto that bizarre 6,000 word posting on facebook. you have to listen. it is as if rodney king from a decade ago happened yesterday. >> bill: rodney king didn't do anything other than destroy

""factor"" tip of the day. that is it for us tonight. please check out it out fox news ""factor"" website, different from billoreilly.com. also, we'd like to you spout off about ""the factor"" anywhere in the world. name and town if you wish to opine. word of the day, don't be gauche when writing to the factor. not a good thing. so now i have to go home. it's going to take me three days. i may not be here on monday. once it starts to snow, everybody in new york city panics. in boston they can handle it. can't handle it here. d.c., they can't handle it. a lot of panicking, but i'll make it. again, thanks for watching us tonight. i'm bill o'reilly. please always remember tha"

Report With Bret Baier : FOXNEWS : February 22, 2013 6:00pm-7:00pm EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,">> bob: he is a character actor. you wouldn't know him until you saw him. >> andrea: ""lincoln"" should win. >> dana: different one. documentary. >> kimberly: that's it for us. thank you for watching. have a great weekend. >> bret: on the sequester, the president has hope. but has much changed? washington at a standstill with less than a week to go. this is ""special report."" >> bret: good evening. i'm bret baier. we are six days away from what president calls the meat cleaver approach to cuts in spending. we have been explaining that it way. $85 billion decrease in the increase in the size of government. $3.6 trillion budget. but because of how the sequester is implemented thestrict way it was designed, white house idea embraced and voted op by members of both parties in congress. signed in law by the president. here we are. less than a week out. the question is the sequester inevitable? ed henry tells us that depends op who is talking. >> hope springs eternal. i will just keep making my case not only to congress but more importantly the american people. >> president obama took a rare question from the press in the oval office and said he is optimistic to cut off the massive indiscrim innocent spending cuts. >> i have also been clear that there is an alternative. which is for us to take the balanced approach i presented where we have more strategic cuts on programs we don't need. we close tax loopholes thatare taken advantage of by well-off. >> more pessimistic tone coming from speaker boehner's office that today charged the president has been awol. other that phone calls to g.o.p. leaders yesterday and spokesman declared sound bites and speeches won't yield results. while the con seventive group crossroad gps launched a new ad today mocking the apocalyptic tone from the president. >> are you willing to see a bunch of first responders lose their jobs, teachers laid off? air traffic controllers and airport security will be a hardship, scram to believe find child care for their kids. >> the sequester was obama's idea in the first place. he signed it in law. >> it seems like every three months around here, there is a manufacturered crisis. >> they continue doom and gloom with the transportation secretary ray lahood warning the airport wait times are about to become more of a mess. >> flights to major cities. like new york, chicago, sanfrancisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes. during peak hours. because we have fewer controllers on staff. >> republican rand paul introduced his own a terptive plan without layoff. charming white house is exaggerating the impact. >> i'm'd say balderdash. it's untrue, unfair, dishonest, disingenuous. the president is making stuff up. he puts law enforcement, firemen and policemen who 98% of them are paid for with the local taxes. says you will lose your local police men because of this. it's not true. >> republican duncan hunter teeing off on the white house for delaying deployment of the uss harry s. truman to the persian gulf and hunter claiming this is more about the drama than budget cuts. pentagon spokesman told fox news it was the right decision to make. that it was all about saving mup.had nothing to do with political drama. bret? >> bret: ed, yesterday, we had gene sperling on with the national economic council of advisors. i asked about the warn act, notices sent out 60 days in advance. letter sent out in september saying that the office of management and budget would cover the legal costs if the government were sued, if the companies were sued rather that the employees didn't get the notices and they would pick up all the legal cost. gene didn't have an answer about that. did the omb get back to us today? >> we were asking budget officials today about some of the issues. today they put out some paper that basically said look, it's not even clear the way the warn act is written that the layoff notices, the furlough notices have to go out, because there are evidents made to shut off the sequester. so it's not clear that the sequester will go forward, though a lot of people thinkit will. it's not clear that the legal cost, for people suing the contractors over losing their job they have to be covered. bottom line, there are decisions issued by the both to suggest that the legal costs would have to be picked up. bottom line when all is said and done this could be a big legal mess. >> bret: the question is why the letters went out in the first place ahead of the election. they didn't want the notices to go out. >> yeah. the white house yesterday when i asked carney about that, delaying it for political reasons they insisted no. the only reason they held back furlough notices before the election they were not up against the sequester deadline like they are now. as you said, there were allegations back then, they were holding it back for political reasons. >> bret: we will follow all the elements. thank you. just as all the talk has be about cutting back and the impact of the sequester, at the same time, the obama administration launched a nationwide tour to help more and more americans get on the receiving end of benefits. even with $16 trillion of debt.and no relief in sight. this 100-city tour is taking off. and freebies are flowing. it's drawn the ire of an influential republican senator. chief congressial senator mike emanuel reports. >> as washington fights over scheduled spending cuts the obama administration launched a 100-city connecting community tour. beaverton, oregon, was the first stop on february 14. representatives of the white house, department of labor, epa, transportation, and hud were sent to promote federal aid in spending. oklahoma senator tom coburn is urging the administration to cap sell the tour when much is made about the impact of sequestration. in this letter sent thursday to the white house office of management and budget, he wrote it is somewhat surprising therefore for the white house to be headlining a 100 city government spending tour. >> we asked for how many people are going on the tour, what is it going to cost, what are the cities and why are we doing this? this is not for political means to exer bait the effectsof the sequester. >> and coburn points out that beaverton have been adept at obtaining federal funds, receiving $2 million in grant and assistance since 2011. at the white house, the press secretary didn't have many details but said the tour isn't a big deal. >> you can find an vim thing and say that this -- an individual thing and say this could be cut. maybe it should be. whatever it is. it represents a drop in the bucket to $85 billion cut. >> everything is a drop in the bucket. we are $16.6 trillion in debt. that is typical washington rationalization. >> earlyer the transportation secretary suggested his part of the tour hit a bump in the road. >> i was supposed to be in orlando and south carolina today. >> meanwhile, the administration is describing the impact of $85 billion in cuts due to begin in a week as devastating, they are pushing for $50 billion in new spending op highways, airports and transit systems.>> they are very interested in our effort to invest in fix it first development in need of maintenance and repair. >> office of management and budget has not responded to the're for comment on the saturday's letter. he suggests doing it by teleconference. considering the nation's debt, he is inklineed to say likely we cannot afford to do it. bret? >> bret: thanks. tom coburn is chris wallace's guest op ""fox news sunday"" with claire

teachers laid off? air traffic controllers andairport security, hardship on a lot of people. seep yours, middle class families scram to believe find child care for their kids. bad idea. a bad idea. >> the sequester was the administration's idea. in they were president obama's idea. >> the so-called ""sequester"" was obama's idea in the first place. he signed it in to law. >> white house lemede recommendd this. >> bret: conservative group crossroad gps launched that ad today, that video. before that you saw the president at the white house. answering president at appearance with the japanese prime minister. bring in our panel. fredbars, ""weekly standard."" juan williams, columnist with the hill. syndicated columnist charles krauthammer. fred, where do you think it stands? what happens? >> sequest her go in effect. it's interesting that president obama misjudgeedboth situation and where the republican interest actually lies in this. this is different from the fiscal cliff. the republicans did nothing then and they got tax hikes which they don't like. here they do nothing and they get spending cuts which they do like that. is part of their agenda. the public, rasmussen has a poll that only a third of americans want to have the sequester not go in to effect. they worry about the automatic cuts. that sounds about right. they seem to be, the public has grown immune or somewhat immune to the claims that relatively small cuts, $85 billion is one-half of 1%. of all federal spending. that if you cut it, it will have a really catastrophic effect on american life. i also think the president overrated his open clout. you know, i keep hearing about how enormously popular he is. he is not particularly popular. his job approval is 51, 52%. that is where president bushwas in 2005. after his re-election. and it's about where the president was even before his re-election last november. he doesn't have great sway over the public. >> bret: you don't think there is negative backlash for republicans if it goes in to effect and he continues the bully pulpit of going to the district and say look at what is going to happen? >> not much, if any. besides, the republicans have ideological reason. part of the republican principles. they want to reduce spending. so does the public. >> bret: juan? >> i have a different point of view. >> bret: not surprising. i am struck by this. >> the polls i have seen, show clearly people are asked who is to blame for the catastrophic situation in washington they say it's the republicans. the latest poll here is 43-34 republicans. when you ask what would youcut, even if it's just republicans what would you cut, would you come down to the republicans say we think we would cut maybe foreign aid. we'd cut maybe unemployment. but on every other count, republicans say keep spending level or increase it. democrats overwhelming, there is nothing the democrats would cut. it seems to me where the rubber meets the road here, you have a tough time selling the republican position. president obama has a tough time in terms of his legacy. the economy i think could be harmed. they estimate 1 hadn't 2 million jobs and that will impact the employment rate. even if you said forget what ray lahood is saying about the long lines at the airport, what does it matter it has consequence on the larger effect on the economystruggling to gape recovery. >> bret: what about fred's point of the public assessment of the sky is falling out of washington and that there is a glazing over. they have heard it a lot. >> the notion wegone crisis to crisis has effect on that. not much changed. at who point do you have impact? the white house is counting on it having impact it puts republicaputpressure on republi. >> so much error, so little time. we are talking about minuscule amount of the economy that will throw us in a recession. this will have some epect the washington area. because they will be furloughed of people workingfor the federal government. but washington area prospered as the rest of the country suffered. people have done well. it will cause the most disruption. tsa an air traffic control because you want to make people upset. so they get angry at republicans. there is a solution to that issue which is done in an hour next week. not in a day. in a hour. where you give the administration discretion how to move the mup around. if you do that, you don't touch single air traffic controller. you can postpone one of tin investments in infrastructure or algae or any other stuff orthe electric cars or solyndra. that is what you would do rationally and you would continue the cut what the country needs. as a aggregate amount, this is trivial amount of money. we are drowning in debt. if you cut two cents we have a catastrophe? >> it is tough to make any cuts if you can't do that. >> bret: they don't want to give the power of the purse over and they should do that. they're not doing it. same way. >> it's a mistake on their part. >> will to ray lahood. >> they are occasionally wrong. >> bret: ray lahood, the transportation secretary today. >> i am trying to wake up members of congress to theidea they need to come to the table, offer a proposal so we don't have the calamity in the air service in america. >> ray lahood of course republican. speaker boehner's office responded quickly, saying today, secretary lahood alleviating the impact of president obama's sequester requires the republicans stepping forward ideas. he should check out hr-5652, the replacement act. we can look at the h.r. 6684, spending reduction act of 2012, sponsored by the majority leader cantor, a republican. filled to the brim with cracker jack republican ideas. >> someone hasn't given us a proposal is president obama. he has given us vague ideas but no proposal. the president said the tiny spending cuts will have astrong effect on unemployment and the economic growth. how about $600 billion in tax increases he demanded in the fiscal cliff and passed? that will have a much bigger impact harmfully on the economy than the spending cu cuts. >> bret: juan, one more thing. $85 billion is the total cost. didn't we pass the hurricane sandy relief with $60 billion? put it in perspective. like the numbers. >> no, look, if you -- remember, the argument that we are hering in washington over that, republicans didn't want to do it. and the people, including republicans in northeast scream bloody murder. i think you will get people not getting services as a result who will scream they don't understand why they don't have the first responders. believe me, the white house from their political perspective are going to make that pressure felt. if you talk about ideas, i haven't heard one idea from the speaker about what loopholes he would close or what he would do to reduce it.to the contrary, the senate democrats put out a plan and the president says -- >> would the white house want to make things worse for the american people? >> they want a deal. >> they would -- they will say listen this is supposed to be across-the-board cut without discrimination, no latitude, every account is cut the same amount. that is why this is a butc butcher's block cut. not smart. >> bret: i think we have six more days to talk about this. next up, the friday lightning round which will be lightning.hi. hi. i'm here to pick up some cacti. it should be under stephens. the verizon share everything plan for small business. get a shareable pool of data... got enough joshua trees?

catherine herridge did a piece. we don't know much about the administration drone program. >> this goes beyond law enforcement. the pressure is law enforcement says it's easy and cheaper an they can't be armed so it's not firing atamericans but for surveillance. the problem is it's intrusive and obvious violation of the privacy. >> bret: there will be more talk about that. winners and losers this week. fred, you start us out. >> winer, chuck hagel. he now has enough republicans and all the democrats, not up with democrat in the senate come out against him, so he will be secretary of defense. the loser is jack lew nominated for treasury secretary. he has to answer dozens of more questions and he will be scrutinized more heavily now that hagel is getting through. >> bret: juan, winners and losers. >> this is not true in fred's household but according to bloomberg, president obama's popularity rating now at 55. and real clear politics has his job approval rating at over 50%. for bloomberg, three-year high. and given all that we are hearing about sequest tration and problems with the economy, people, most miles per hours don't think the nation isheaded in the right direction it's amazing how popular president obama is. in terms of my loser it's hoop nature this week. it's -- human nature this week. sad week. jesse jackson junior admitting he misused campaign funds for mackal jackson's -- michael jackson's hat, elvis memorabilia. sad news about the former senator fathering a daughter of former senator and it's one thing that makes you want to cry inside. >> bret: charles? >> winer ""argot"" for best picture. you heard it here last, it's a consensus pick i think. loser, i agree jesse jackson junior. and the tragedy is this. this is a man of great talent, promise and he sold his soul for a rolex watch. it doesn't get sadder than that. >> bret: you whipped through that lightning round. you whiffed through it. >> go back to that argument we were having -->> bret: i'll never make it to the end of the show. >> charles is famous for filibustering. >> i know. >> we upset you by finishing early. >> bret: early. finished early. >> as i said, so much error, sair, solittle time. >> give it a shot. drones. >> it gives me the willies the drones, because it's big brother watching. the opportunity for misuse is great. >> drones ought to be used in yemen but not over the united states. the last thing you want drop hovering over your house. obviously it's not a weapon. but for looking in your life there is enough of that going on right now. extreme cases perhaps. but you probably have to judge and court order before you should have a drop over your head. >> judge andrew napolitano would be proud of you, charles. all right. thank you, panel. stay tupeed for an update on what seems to have been the top story of the week. ne revvin]♪ [ male announcer ] every car we build must make adrenaline pump and pulses quicken. ♪ to help you not just to stay alive... but feel alive. the new c-class is no exception. it's a mercedes-benz through and through. see your authorized mercedes-benz dealer for exceptional offers through mercedes-benz financial services. more ""likes."" more tweets. so, beginning today, my son brock and his whole team will be our new senior social media strategists. any questions?

erk jerk. they took a stand by not shaking his hand. on tuesday president obama welcomed the 1972 miami dolphins to the white house for a ceremony commemorating their undefeated season. some players skipped the trip over political dips like offensive lineman who commented, ""i just don't believe in this administration at all so i don't belong. anyone on the left or right has to respect one man's opinion."" and center who said ""i don't want to be in the room with those people and pretend i am having a good time. i can't do that. if it angers people, so be it."" the rest of the team was happy to visit the white house which they missed because of watergate. for those who young to remember watergate president nixon built a huge gate across the potomac river. >> what? >> yep. for more let's go to thisdog. >> that is unbelievable. >> we said for more and then that added little to the story. >> speak for yourself. that was awesome. >> buck, welcome to the show. >> welcome, sir. >> he wrote a column saying the guys from the team who refused to go to the white house are idiots. agree or disagree? or agree or disagree? >> it is absolutely their right not to go to the white house. this is what makes america, america. if you show up to the white house you should be respectful, but the fact of the matter is they are within their rights. it is not like thailand where i was in a movie theater once -- a normal one by the way. everybody has to stand up and worship the king. we don't do that here. president obama annoys some people and they don't want to go to the white house, that's good for them. >> you said in the green roomthe players who numbered president obama are heros, why do you say that? >> first of all i am furis for different reasons. i played on the 1972 dolphins and i didn't get a phone call about this. this is ridiculous. i didn't get to go because of watergate. that was sad. for these guys in assisted of going to the white house -- instead of going to the white house to participate in shaking the president a ease happened just go to the watergate hotel and put a little tape on the door and recreate history jie. what position did you play? >> d tackle. >> what he said. >> i am guessing you played nickleback like you do on your i-pod. that was a good joke. >> that was a good joke. >> i am proud of that joke. >> imogen, not many people get to meet the president. should you go if you are invited out of respect for the office if not for the man? >> it is america, but this is a problem -- i love the constitution and i love whenpeople ask me why does royalty exist in britain? the queen is above politics. she has a 90% approval rating and she is there as a symbol of national unity and pride, the head of $2 -- of 2 billion people. it is sad when people can't separate the office of the presidency and the president who is the president 6789 it is the nature of the beast. >> i met the president a couple of times, and it is not that exciting. >> oh, mr. big shot. >> it is just another guy. once you high five him and you say his tie looks nice. he works out too. >> i met two presidents and the queen and it was a very big deal. >> well, difference of opinion. >> i met ke$ha once. i drank the beer el presidente once. >> jim plan deers says he doesn't want to be in a room with those people and pretend he is having a good time.which is how everyone feels about you, but we suck it up. thoughts? >> clearly not because you insulted me in what i like to call my office. these guys are allowed to do this, and i am allowed to think they are a bunch of a-holes. furthermore, people who don't live in miami, everybody hates the 1972 dolphins. it was the easiest schedule in the league that year. they celebrate every time an undefeated team gets defeated with champagne and throwing it in everyone's face. one thing i am upset about, per mercury morris went. i loathe him out of all of them. he is the running back and openly cheers when another team is undefeated. i wanted mercury morris not to go so i could hate him more. i don't where my dan hampton jersey anymore. he was part of the chicago bears. we didn't go because of the challenger disaster. now about two years ago president obama, a bears fan, nicely decided to honor the team. but dan hampton had a problemwith it and cooperate be bothered to go. and couldn't be bothered to go. >> his football knowledge is exceptional. >> we just don't have a lot to do in chicago. >> if you don't want to go to a party though, it is okay. you invite me to cocaine parties all the time, and i politely decline. >> that's because you know it is mostly laxatives laxatives and once i make more money that will end. >> oddly this is america and you don't have to go. this happened a year or two ago. nascar drivers were invited to the white house and a couple declined because they said they were busy. i tweeted i thought that was bad. i thought they should go, and i was accused of being in favor of being a crime of the dignity of the rule. if the president invites you to the white house, you go. >> when bush was in office there wasn't a lot of respect for the office thing. he wasn't like saying let'smake jokes. he wasville fight and hated. he was villa fied and hated. we know there saw loft sensitivity about making jokes around this president. he is thin skinked. i think these guys are allowed to pull out on this one. if i was invited to this white house, which i would not be, i would not go down there. >> that's why you would never be invited. >> fair play. >> i would go. do you think they would ask me. >> you would go? >> it is the white house. >> that's what i'm saying. >> you steal a couple of napkins and put them on your wall. anyone is pre extending to be happy about this -- pretending to be happy about, this it is president obama. nobody wants to hang out with those jerks. >> from football to filner, they are behind the slime and going to war for a predatory. bob filner has fans believe it or not. on monday they held a rally at city hall in support of san diego's mayor arguing he is being persecuted for his political agenda rather than his perviness.it was called standing with mayor filner and due process. at one point the crowd sang ""reshall overcome"" and one letter read allowed quoted a woman who said she has known filner for three decades and he, quote, never sexually harassed me. here is more. >> he is not being tried in the court of law. he is being tried in a kangaroo court. she being tried by the media. this is not the way we do things in this country. >> this is very reminiscent of the 1950s mccarthy era. in the 1950s all a person had to do was p so int -- point to someone and say i think they are a communist. >> those were the good old days. speaking of protests -- >> what do you want? when do you want it?how do you want it? >> what a bunch of sheep. imogen, you said in the green room you agree with the pro filner protestors and the only thing the guy is guilty of is loving too much. please explain. >> absolutely. first of all, i couldn't work out why this man was in an office. 81% of people in san diego want to get rid of him. apparently it is all to do with leverage. the california attorney general is looking into prosecuting him. it is a whole thing of a plea deal or plea bargain if you are in office. there was a bit of a deal in office with the comp comp troller and maybe that is what he is doing. >> i think that is what he is doing. jake, there was a certain aspect of the filner rally you thought was fantastic. >> i like that they sang ""reshall overcome."" it reminded me when the sagafter merger happened. los angeles at one point and singing on television the sag after people siping ""reshall overcome."" one of the great protest songs and the fact that commercial actor can now get health insurance. >> is this proof there are people somewhere that will defend anyone? >> absolutely. when your defense against sexual harassment charges is find one person you have not sexually harassed? look over here. he has yet to grab my behind. well she didn't get touched so it must be okay. there must be a political back story as to why anybody would support this guy. he was like going grandmas. he was grabbing the elder generation as well as his office help. maybe he thinks he can get a better deal. what is the deal if you promise not to prosecute me i will stop grabbing ladies in places they are not supposedto be grabbed? >> they say he is in mediation with the san diego city attorney and the always delightful gloria allred. they may work out a deal that includes his resignation. i don't know why he should get a defense. >> the tickle defense didn't work at all. he had to resign. >> pro and anti-filner protestor had --s say you should die a painful death in a horrible automobile accident. it is nice a shared hatred of you can bring people together like that. don't you? >> it is cool if they know who i am. i just don't know why that question would come up. i will take your word for it. there has to be other people this guy has not fondled. it can't just be that one woman. that's why i propose an on-line campaign where every woman in san diego who has not been fondled or compromised by this predator goes out there and tells her story. it will be called filner and filner and the first one has been taken. it is called the tickled down affect. >> so dot-com was taken?>> 20 years ago right after the dot-com bust. >> may want to set up an offshore server. >> are politicians worse than ever, or do we just know more about them? >> why do they want to keep their jobs in the first place? once you are caught being a creep embrace being a creep. i am hanging out with joe francis now. that's my life. why does everyone want to keep their job? i think we know more about them, and i think what we are finding out is white dudes are creeps. >> vote for women. >> it is true. >> when was the last time -- i i can't remember a female politician being caught up in a sex scandal. women only in office from now on. >> wasn't janet napolitano, something was there or something? 8 guy am i just hoping? >> why would you hope that?>> i am pretty sure margaret thatcher had to marry terry bradshaw.   from pig to pigskin, should american youth avoid the game of brute? they are talking about the game of violence suing overhead injuries and even president obama if that's his real name saying he is unsure he would allow a hypothetical son to play. and it is having an affect on kids' leagues. a lawmaker introduced a bill to ban the game for children under age 11. and school boards in other states have tried similar measures. participation in youth football declined 6% last year which should comfort critics who said there is no conceivable argument to continue this practice -- continue to practice this inhumane spectacle. here is footage.>> they are just playing, oh god. jake, you were a defensive back are to the university of nebraska so i am eager to hear your thoughts. >> thank you. that was the happiest time in my life. i like malcolm glad well is against football. he says it takes 10,000 hours of practice to get good at something. you can't practice football for 10,000 hours because you will die. it will kill you. i wish they would ban football. it would be easier for me growing up. take the football resources and allocate them to like building better message boards for nerds to argue on. >> there aren't enough of those. >> bigger and better. >>- q. i is football bad for america or is it the opposite which i believe is not bad. >> which would be good. >> good for america and football it is yes good foramerica. nothing is going to encourage the chinese to take us over like by invading and having no contact sports for kids. i was forced in school to wrestle. i did boxing growing up. you should actually learn what getting your butt kicked in sports means about getting your butt kicked. itit is a very good thing for you. >> if you are in school and teachers force you to wrestle, tell somebody. imogen, you understand we are talking about real football and not that horrid sport of soccer? i am talking real football. >> actually i do think that this is a bit of an outrage. football players are four times than average americans to die from brain disease. fine. but kids need to exercise. obesity is a bigger danger to americans. a third of kids are overweight or obese. they nee to exercise and keepmoving. i'm afraid it is a nanny state gone too far. >> bill, you were suspended three times from college for repeatedly stealing the football player dirty uniforms from the locker room. >> thank you foretelling everyone i went to college. didn't work out so well on that one, did it? first of all let's solve this problem quickly. the players have changed in body type, weight, the whole spectrum in the last twenty years. their size has doubled. what hasn't changed is the dimensions of the field. you have to make it wider and longer. you're welcome, america. vice president obama, sexist, sexist, sexist. if i had a son i wouldn't force him to play. he has two daughters. i hillary fer to you, season two, episode seven of ""the cosby show"" titled"" rudy suitsup"" where she joins pee wee football and guess what, she runs right overall of them. you know what they called her? sweet feet. sweet feet! sweet feet. >> so you say impeachment? >> right. >> girls can play football.   coming up, should you consider legally changing your name? buck sexton discusses his latest book. and which state has the hottest residents? the story mainstream media doesn't president what -- doesn't want you to hear. you are watching fnc. stick around.which state has the weirdest accent? it is the story you can't afford not to know.the website business insider conducted a survey on how americans feel about other states and the results couldn't be more resulty. favorite food? most people said new york with california and louisiana also getting nods. favorite state? california followed by colorado. most arrogant and rudest, new york and new york. hottest residents, california. weirdest accents? massachusetts and then louisiana and alabama and minnesota and new york and new jersey. and finally, most beautiful scenery? colorado. i believe we have tape of a first time visitor to the rocky mountains. they are magestic. don't even know what thatmeans. jake, new york was voted the most arrogant and the rudest. is that because people who are not from new york are just jealous a-holes? >> absolutely. to be honest i was shocked to find out there was other states beyond new york or california. they don't do any show business in those other states and i don't care. >> buck, texas came in first for the state people would like to see kicked out of the union. is it wise to mess with texas? i am told 245 is a bad thing to do. >> you don't mess with texas. th is a business insider poll. business insider with a lot of finance guys so watch msnbc. yes, i said. it that's why you get a skewed thing with the hatred toward texas. they nailed massachusetts. when you are on a date with a girl in massachusetts she said we will ride in your car and we will maybe have some popcorn afterwards. it is over. a southern accent adds threepoints and a boston accent takes two away. >> some say since you are not a real american i should skip you on the story. i would gre with them, but unfortunately we have to fill an hour. >> i agree as well. i will just get in trouble because i am a guest in your country and then if i insult it it is over. i am a, noer now though and i can say new yorkers are rude and arrogant. however, i was just finishing up my new book and this particular chapter is about sex. apparently mississippi is the dumbest state. that would concur in the sex chapter because they have the most std's in america. >> mississippi is burning. >> wow. >> bill, ninety 8% of the people sur -- 98% of the people surveyed say the worst state is whatever one you happen to be in at the time. thought? >> i don't like the theme of the show. this study proved the united states of america is like one big new york apartment.we don't know anything about our neighbors and everything we know is completely wrong. i brought this back to new york because we are rude and era gapt. arrogant. >> new york won best sports fans. you can make a case or not. but it also won worst sports fans. the last time i checked boston is not in new york. >> you just proved your point. >> coming up, what is it like to be owned more than anybody else on twitter. first, what is up with the obama's new dog? something impeachable i'm sure. pbjócqkb+ámñt>zyû>> sunny is a portuguese water dog. clearly we must discuss this important news in the -- >> lightning round. >> buck, this, and i can't -- i don't understand why everybody doesn't get this. th is obviously an attempt to distract the american people from benghazi and the nsa and the drone debate and the complete and utter failure of our horrible economy. >> you said all that needs to be said. >> i would just offer on top of that one portuguese water dog, get yourself a yellow lab. right? come on. the other side is the name bo and sunny, these are the names people give dogs when they are not the ones naming them. okay, bo and sunny. if obamas had a sense of humor they would call them achmed and lennon or something like that. no? >> i want to get back to being serious.at a time when americans can't find one job how shameful is it for the president and his family to have two dogs? it is a slap in the face of the american public. >> i am going to say something controversial. i like this dog. i want to pet this dog. >> go to commercial! >> bars and tone! >> i want to give the dog a hug. he has little white boots. sunny, i want to give it a hug and kiss it and pet the dog. i will say it. >> you are like the mayor of san diego. >> i want to get back to something buck was saying. sunny is a portuguese water dog. i guess an american water dog is not good enough for our president? >> he is probably not even studying the dogs right. he should look to the uk royals for that. the queen with her corgis. dogs can make you popular and so yes he is manipulating the american people. >> bill, even you must agreeobama must be impeached over this. >> i felt bad we were discussing obama and jedediah couldn't do the segment with us. she gave us a couple names. the the first is benghazi for the dogs and impeachys and finally secret muslims. >> achmed and leonard are more offensive? >> i like the dogs and i want to hug them and pet them. >> that video we showed that the white house put out was a 30-second video and cost millions of dollars. >> taxpayer money. >> americans can't tour their own white house, but they can spend $17.3 million -- $17.36 million on that video. >> $20,000 to give those dogs a perm alone. >> send pea pictures of -- send me pictures of cats and dogs on twitter. >> do they need a second airplane for the second dog? the one dog will travel on itsown plane. >> we know that's not true. >> why didn't you just go with it? >> i don't know. am i going to the next story or am i not? i can't because it is not in the prompter. >> make the camera nod. >> the next story, a blogger is going to quit the internet for a year because he is burnt out. david roberts who writes for the environmental news site says he spends too much time for all things on-line. quote, i think in tweets now my hands start twitching if i am away from my phone for more than 30 seconds. i can't take a pee without getting board. it represents only a tiny unrepresentative slice of the american people and has become my world. i spend more time there than in the real world. as i read this story all i thought was why couldn't this be you? >> i will not log off. i will say it. i will never log off. if this guy wants to log off, that's fine. i will not log off. >> will you log off? >> no.>> will you log off, sir? >> no, i will not log off. >> you can't handle the log off. >> can't anybody just cut down on things anymore? everything has to be either all the time or i am not doing it for a year. why not just cut back? >> have i a theory about this guy. one he is a huge nerd. two, he is one to over share and perhaps think his life is more important than it is. he talks about how he was board board -- bored. if there is anything such as tmi, i am bored when i pee is tmi. >> how long does this guy pee? that is industrial freak strength. >> i'm -- imogen, would you think of trying this? >> this guy is doing it as a publicity stunt. we are talking about him now. there is the whole thing of how i have come back to the internet and talk to you aboutmy year away from the internet. >> for him to be real about this, he would have to go tom hanks in ""castaway"" with long hair like he was living in the woods. otherwise it would be like i haven't been on my computer for a year. you have to go above and beyond, no electronics for a year. >> bill, you don't own a computer or if you did you wouldn't have any place to plug it in in the dumpster you live in. basically this story is meaning less to you. sorry, basically this story is meaning less to you? >> now i will answer. he is saying the world of the internet is limited and he wants to see the real america outside of the internet. that would be a five-block radius and that is as much as people travel on a daily basis. no one goes anywhere and no one sees anything. you go to the internet and that's where everything is. otherwise there is a small bit of area. secondly, the only thing out there is melanoma.i should know. i am covered in it. >> that's midevil times. >> it is a five-block radius for me. i am scared to leave my dumpster. >> i get if he wants to spend less time. i took a 10-daybreak from twit twitter. >> it was great! >> it was horrible for me. they got me to come back on. they would not stop e-mailing me. i get taking a break and cutting back. i think he is completely sincere about what he is doing. i just don't understand why you would take yourself off the entire internet for an entire year. >> anytime somebody does this like routine like i am quitting the internet, they #r* back in two weeks, every time. don't announce it. just fade away. fade away and come back when you feel like coming back. you don't need to make a big production. >> what do you want to make real friends? >> certainly not. >> human beings? crazy. >> thanks for bringing us down.   coming up, spain threatensan anti-british alliance as a diplomatic rogue over jaw gibraltar intensities. we are not doing that story. instead we have the vice president of white castle here to settle a grievance against bill and give us delicious burgers. seriously.last week we sent bill schulz to a sandcastle competition and sadly nobody buried in a six foot hole like we hoped. bill ran into a guy from white castle and made a shocking confession. >> now we're talking. >> now we are talking. there you go. >> how long were you walking for white castle? >> only 25 years. >> 25 years? you are a vet. i stole a salt shaker from white castle one time and every time i went back theycalled me salt shaker. >> were you drunk? >> they called me blackout and i think i left with one shoe. >> white castle corporate heard and contacted us about settling the matter. let's welcome the white castle vice president jaime richardson. welcome. >> great to be here. >> i understand you have a few items to read and maybe give to bill. >> we do. we have often thought why let a little bit of petty larceny stand in the way of what can be a great friendship. my friend, we would like to complete your set and we have a pepper shaker for you. >> thank you so much. look at this. i will say it was less stealing and more just oh this happened to be in my hand. when i moved into east harlem i heard a choir and saw that a white castle was two blocks from where i live. one it is has to indulge when one moves in. it was like norm going into cheers and everybody says salt shaker. i thought it was because i was the only white guy.i thought it was the 21st century version of cracker. oh they like me. my name is bill. they call me salt shaker. and then they said the reason they call me that is because i walked out with the salt shaker. and then i do remember i have a salt shaker on the top of my refrigerator that was there for a couple months. i tried to correct them the rest of the time i lived there, but i was salt shaker. >> what else do you have for bill? >> it is a story of lost and found. is the white castle lost and found never closes like the restaurants. we found your shoes. we didn't know you were part of the k swiss club. >> yes, it smells like dumpster number two on the corner. i am getting nostalgic. smell it. it smells like east harlem. >> and a presidential pardon. a letter from our ceo saying you are always welcome at the castle even if you are not -- you might end up in a court of law, but you are okay at the castle.>> america has real castles and now i am tight with the president. beat it, blondie. >> jaime brought a hundred white castle burgers. if you take a wide shot you can see them on the table. there is more on the box. the studio smells amazing right now. let me ask you couple of questions. talk me through the making of a white castle burger. what makes it what it is? >> 100% beef, steam grill owed a bed of onions. bakery fresh bun on top and one perfect pickle. >> why only in 12 states? >> we are family owned after 92 years. we had a theft problem with salt shakers and that set us back awhile ago. but we adjusted. >> it was an accident. >> but you had the herald and kumar movies and did that boost sales? >> it was great for sales. it introduced us to a new generation of cravers and to get to the castle. >> a great time to get into other states. >> we are in every state with the frozen food. if you do those just right itis as close as you can get to the drive-thru. >> white castle is i think people who have had it it is the best drunk food of all time. have you considered an advertising campaign on that? >> my friend, we are there when you need. it think of it as an oasis, a bright shining light on the highway. >> you a lot of time had -- times i was literally in the middle of the highway enjoying my fries. >> two last questions on the beastie boys album ""license to kill"" they reference white castle in five songs. do you take credit? >> they are craver tots extreme. >> on ""the new style"" mike d says i chill at white castle because it is the best, but fly at fat burger when i am way out west. if you had white castle way out west he wouldn't have to mention fat burger. >> and ice cube wouldn't have to go there at 2:00 in the morning to get the fat burger. >> are you going to l.a.soon? i see a theme here. >> the l.a. in n out, but you need white castle in l.a. >> we have the crave mobile. >> what is the crave mobile? >> it is a white castle on wheels. wow, it is awesome. >> really? >> yes, we can cook up as many burgers as we can in a white castle restaurant. >> does it go around manhattan? >> it will be here soon. >> will you let us know when? >> we will. >> can we get free burgers. >> you can tonight. >> put me in my place. >> crave on, my friend. >> do you have a comment on the show? e-mail us. fox news.com. do you have a video of your animal doing something? go to fox news.com/red eye and click on submit a video. coming up, the post game report from jedediah bila and we will all eat white castle burgers.coming up tomorrow on the next ""red eye."" return appearances from gavin mcguinness and janice dean and dan bolva. time to go back to jedediah bila for the post game report. >> before i begin i had to tell you i had a full blown food gasm . you better dig in for me,delicious -- i can't even think of anything else. we'll see how this goes. >> it smells great. >> i can imagine. i can smell it from here. >> i need a salt shaker. >> i will start with the miami dolphins and i have to start with you, andy. there is a quote that interests me. the former defensive lineman said i want to be careful because mom said that if you have nothing good to say about someone, then don't say anything. that's why we don't talk about bill. does he not have a point here? >> he has a point, but i don't see why you can't go to the white house and say thank you to the president and shake his hand and then go home. >> bill, you look up -- you look upset about what i just said. >> no, just hurry up. these things will not eat themselves. i wasn't listening. >> i will go to the buck nato which would be buck sexton. how are you? i want to thank you. you clarified our president is not a monarch. unfortunately he now has the nsa coming after you.i have to apologize in advance. hopefully you are not hiding anything dangerous. >> there will be nothing after the irs is through. bring it nsa. they are much scare yes, sir than any nsa program. >> i think they are tied for scary the nsa and the irs. >> can't they kill you? >> you may be on to something. >> are you not a fall security guy? i feel like you should know this. >> the irs looked a lot scare yes, sir until we saw the video of them doing like the electric slide at the conference. then it was like, oh yeah, deduction. let's talk about it. i am so getting audited. >> i have to go to filner. the creepest man ever with the creepest smile ever. buck you said when you are -- your defense against sexual harassment charges are to find one person you have not sexually harassed it is a problem. bill, did you follow that?>> i was molesting a craving burger right now. >> it was sexual harassment so maybe i should let you go. >> i want to point out, telling jedediah to hurry up, it doesn't do anything. the show has to be a certain length. >> i don't follow. >> which you should know because you are -- you are sort of on the show. >> it has only been six and half years. >> my name is salt shaker. >> imogen, you said the way we solve this problem is to vote for women. instinctively i wanted to go against that. i wanted to say, no, this is not about gender. but then i sat here and i thought i can't think of one woman in this problem. i am with you. i think the problem is just men. it is not politicians. it is men across the board. >> i did say that and i think i will get a lot of hate tweets tonight. i won't look at my twitter feed. women don't do this.they wouldn't sext -- no. >> i mean, she just was sorting out britain. >> i agree. i told you i wanted to battle it, but i think you might be right. let's talk about some good ball. buck, you said that you should actually learn about getting your butt kicked in sports by getting your butt kicked in sports. it is really manly. i have to say i love this side of you i am seeing, this anti-obama right thing enthusiast who is manly and i am all for it. >> i don't even know what you are saying at this point. >> you get out of here. just eye contact.>> we will take this off stage. >> imogen, you talked about obesity. i couldn't agree with you more. it is funny we are talking obesity eating white castle burgers. >> to cru he. >> what do you say to people who say great, but let's find a sport that is a little less dangerous and we can battle obesity in the process? >> that's fine. but i have been here for three and a half years. football is part of america. we all sit down and watch the super bowl. it is the fabric of america. let them play football. >> i agree. i agree 100%. also while we are with you on the mass and polls on the united states, you say you are currently writing the chapter in your book about sex? >> yes. >> go on. >> it is everything you need to know about everything so there had to be a chapter about sex in it and i was looking at various american states. and mississippi has scary

on FOX : FOXNEWS : February 16, 2013 11:00am-11:30am EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,"i would stay away. >> the chinese are kicked out of the market. they got those tariffs. >> details, details. dave is on now.   well, if at first you don't succeed -- >> today no area holds more promise than our investments in american energy. >> the president making new calls for more green spending. the same week a government report revealing some major misuse in a green grant. 150 million taxpayer dollars going to electric battery company where inspectors found employees playing video games, card games, cards, working at animal shelters, all while on the clock. and the only batteries they're building, so far they're in south korea. we keep hearing stories like this. so at a time when we're desperately looking for places to cut the federal budget, is this a perfect place to start? hi, everybody. welcome to ""forbes on fox.""let's go in with steve forks, rick you thinker, elizabeth mcdonald, morgan brennan, rich carlguard and mike. steve, if you want to cut waste, is this the place to start? >> sure, david. green energy a great place to save green dollars. if green energy had any promise, entrepreneurs would be in on it. in terms of clean energy, we have it in our backyard with natural gas, remove obstacles to that, we'll have all the clean energy we want and need and export it. >> rick, you're against government waste. this was an incredibly wasteful program. is this the place we should start cutting? >> i actually came up with a very short quote that i think speaks to this point better than i could ever hope to. so i'm gog read it. federal investment in science and basic research has led to numerous innovations and commercial successes from laser lasers, from the internet to mri scanners. do you know who said that? mitt romney in his book ""no apology, the case for american greatness."" that is the point.look, government has always been involved in our greatest progress, they're always going to be involved. all the things we count on today, government played a role in. there have always been the sad saps and the nay sayers who want to just not move forward, leave things as they are. these investments are critical. and by the way, the actual losses that we sustained in this clean energy supporting programs, 3.6% have gone wrong. that's about a third of what the estimate was -- >> mike, the lists are as long as my a. companies like a 123. it's not just solyndra. evergreen solar, beacon power. we've long list of companies that have either failed or are failing that we've tried to pump up with government money. >> david, with my research, i found 14 failing solar companie that have already cost taxpayers over $3 billion. if president obama wants to play venture capitalist with taxpayer money, he should remember this: that the type of progress thatrick is alluding to is in early stage r and d. it's not in giving huge vast sums of taxpayer money for companies to operate and tax credits forever. this is the big problem for obama. the private sector, which would buy these goods, doesn't want them. >> perfect example of that, morgan, is electric cars. they keep trying to fist electric cars on the american public. they don't want them. tesla has a new electric car. they have over $400 million in loan guarantees for the federal government. turns out, according to the ""new york times,"" they don't deliver what they promise. >> yeah. i'm going to stay away electric that issue right now for a little bit. what i am gog say is, yes, we are seeing a lot of waste and i do think there is a lot of room to streamline that waste. but i don't think we should be cutting off all green spending. going back to president obama and what he pitched this week in his state of the union speech, he's talk being a $2 billion clean energy transportation fund. yes, he talks about electric vehicles. i have my issues with those. but he's also talking about going back to steve's point,natural gas and domestically produced biofuel. if we want to compete against on the world stage, against china or india or brazil, then we need to be look at those areas. >> we need in the gas. i wish he would tell the epa that. rich, what about the argument that rick made, which is we're always hearing about government being the pioneer, that government is the seed capital for innovation. is that true? >> he makes half a point, you know. but the structure is all wrong. if you look -- so many of the examples that rick talked about, chiefly the internet came through military r and d. military r and d -- al gore. military r and d works because there is a sense of urgency. there is an exist tensionial threat. the actual development of the companies, when john f. kennedy said we're going to put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960, the reason that we were able to do so and leap ahead of the soviet union is because of thesemiconductor companies in silicon valley. yeah, the military bought a lot of semiconductor tips during that period. but guess what? these were privately funded companies and they had p and l's they had to worry about. that's the key difference between these green technology boondoggles. >> so e mac, are they all boondoggles? do they pay off or not? clearly the one we mentioned at the beginning is a boondoggle. >> the ones we have now are boondoggles. i agree with rick. the technologies that seem to be working coming out of the government come from nasa or the military. and that's what we're seeing working. of course, a lot of spaghetti taxpayer dollars thrown against the wall. the market don't want electric cars or electric battery cars. it leaves them feeling like they'll be stranded in the woods without any gas or any power to get out of the woods. it stresses them out. so we talk a lot also about nat gas, yes, it's helped by the federal government, but that was a resource that was sittingthere. electric batteries had to be developed by people with a lot of taxpayer money. >> morgan, even folks like from the ""washington post,"" charles lane, was talking about how americans just don't want electric cars. for all the money we pour, for all the tax breaks we give to people who buy them, americans still don't want them because they deliver inferior performance at a much higher cost, like much of what the government does. >> yeah. so going back to my point, we streamline where we're make these investments and there is a wealth of data that shows that some of these investments have been very wasteful. going back to natural gas, there is a lot more the government can do. great example, we should be building out infrastructure with some of our green money to be ship to go places like china where demand is skyrocketing. >> a big battle over that right now. the question is, which side the president will come down on. but steve, the fact is that so often behar lip service given to things like natural gas. but look where they're spending the money and it's on these battery issues that always fail,or wind mills that don't perform as they're claimed. >> yeah. rich made a good point about r and d, government has a role in r and d. but in terms of development, it's got to be the private sector and liquefied natural gas, the government will block a lot of those facility attention, even though some are up and ready to go. so we've got a huge market. here and around the world. let's remove the obstacles. that is clean energy. we have it already. >> rick, what about that? natural gas, if we want to go with some kind of government support for things that will get us independent from the oil sheikhs, go with natural gas. >> i have no problem with natural gas. the president has it right with all of the above. >> the president says that, but he's not doing it! that's the point. tell that to the epa. >> did you know that when the original car was invented, when it came about, americans didn't respond to it. they thought the horse and buggies were fine. >> so you think -- [ laughter ] >> you think eventually americans will grow to love the electric -- hold on a second.eventually american also grow to love the electrical car? >> yes, it will. >> until that happens, we have to pour all these billions into it. do you agree, steve? >> absolutely not. entrepreneurs will do it. what made the car something working people could afford was henry ford, he did not work for the raw government, got no money from the south government. he did it on his own and that's wait it should be done. >> there is no venture capitalist who is going to put in their portfolio all of those battery operated cars because they know the markets don't want it because people get stressed out. they know they'll be stranded if the battery runs out. people want gas. these are going to be expensive toys to drive to the neighborhood grocery store. >> rich, the fact is -- hold on a second. we have another example of this, which is wind power. for 20 years we have been subsidizing wind power. we just agreed to spend another $12 billion on wind power in the last budget deal that was made. and over 20 years, it cost more to get energy from wind than it did 20 years ago before webegan, rich. >> yeah, you know, funny enough you mention that. on saturday i was riding my bike where there are all kinds of wind mills in northern california. it was so windy, i almost got blown off my bicycle and yet, not a single wind mill was turning. explain that one. >> i don't think those are ever going to pay off. we got to leave it at that. coming up next, one college is getting a lot of praise for helping struggling graduates repay their loans. this is a trend

one college is ready to help. spring arbor university in michigan is promising incoming freshmen it will pay off their student loans if they can't find a job on graduation that pays more than 20 grand a year. sounds good, right? john says wrong. john, explain the flip side.>> this is just a terrible idea. it's very anti-college student, too. what you want senior year, realistically is to be scared to death if you can't find a job, you can't pay off your loans. here is a program that will tell students don't worry what happens senior year. worst case, we'll cover your down side. it's so antistudent and it's not going to go national. there is no way. >> so john is all for the fear factor, the fear factor is what gets people out there to get a good job. >> it scared me just listening to him. i love this idea. i think it's great. finally a private college stepping up and saying, let's think about the american family. let's think about the students first. i wish other colleges would cut tuition first and not gouge american families. but i think this only works at the private level because we've got these public universities operating on the taxpayer nickel. i don't think the taxpayer will go for that. >> steve. >> a good experiment or not? >> they have a right to make that experiment. but why don't they use that money to cut the tuition in thefirst place? not have that disincentive to find the better paying job. how about getting more bloat out of not just that college. i'm sure there is a little bit, but out of universities, which have expanded in terms of their administrative costs because it's subsidized by the u.s. government. by the way, david, all of this is going to be academic as on-line education comes on and you get $1,000 what you're paying $50,000 for. >> don't tell me that. i'm paying $6,000. morgan, nobody is closer to school debt than you are. you still paying it off? >> i am, and i will be for 25 years. so i'm all for this concept. and actually i would even take it a step further and shift it the government like we've seen this idea of loan repainment contingent upon income like we see in the u.k. and australia. i think there is a lot of accountability lacking on the graduation end of student education. and i think more than that, it's also the fact that so many of our students are getting educated for jobs that don't exist instead of the ones thatdo. >> mike, what about this idea? >> this is an idea, david, that must have come from the obama administration. [ laughter ] it pushes redistribution of wealth and disincentives to word of knowledge as john pointed out, why am i going to look for a job when i know that somebody that has a job and pays tuition at the school will help pay for my tuition? i don't like this idea. >> that's true. rich, the fact is it may cost more than 20,000 a year to pay off the debt, so maybe they'll say, i won't work for a $20,000 a year for a couple years and let the college pay off my debt. >> for this little private institution, it's a hail mary pass. steve put his finger on the issue. on-line technology will blow away 25 to 50% of colleges over the next ten or 20 years. so why not let them try? it's a private institution. it's a donor -- if the donor base doesn't like it, they'll let them know soon enough. draw the line. don't try it at a publicuniversity, but small liberal arts college, private college, why not? >> morgan, what about that? if it's kept in the private level, are you for extending this into public colleges and getting the government involved? >> i'm definitely for it on the private level. i'm not so sure how i feel about it on the public level. if we shift it to the government, i'd be all for doing this across the board with all loans. >> there is no such thing as private college. >> i'm interested in john's incentive argument, when you have this massive piled mound of debt. >> disinventive. >> that's true. you got to get a job to pay off your loan. that's an interesting part of the argument. >> that's the point, you want the fear factor to get a job. let's end the myth about private colleges. all colleges in the u.s., with the exception of two that i can think of, are reliant on federal student loans to put the students through. so this notion that somehow we can limit it to private schools, we are gog pay for this.>> morgan, what about mike's argument about a disincentive, that this will -- maybe people will be reluctant to get a job for more than 20,000 a year 'cause they want the college to pay off their debt. >> the bottom line is people have to pay off their student loans. you can't declare bankruptcy on it. we still have the highest unemployment rate among young adults right now. i don't think that's going to change. i think americans, young adults that want jobs will get jobs no matter what. they want to be able to work. >> last word, the only person still paying off her school debt. are these union protests outside the capitol the reason why nothing is getting done inside the capitol? the ""cashin' in"" crew will discuss it. first, a $15 billion government program to revamp foreclosed homes. the president's calling it a jobs plan. but will it work [ woman ] ring. ring. progresso.your soups are so awesomely delicious my husband and i can't stop eating 'em! what's...that... on your head? can curlers! tomato basil, potato with bacon... we've got a lot of empty cans.

[ laughter ] >> all right. john, what about the specific one, $15 billion is what the president wants to spend. he says it will create jobs and you say? >> yeah. i'm listening to rick. he resides in the scene of the world. he sees those jobs created in youngstown and says, oh, wow,look at what the government can do. but the good ideas will be starved of capital sos bad ideas can receive it in abundance. yes, they'll spend the $15 billion and jobs will be created in one area. but at what cost? >> what do you say to that? >> that's a very strange argument. in other words, it's wrong 'cause i've seen it work? is that what you're saying? that makes no sense. >> you're looking at the observable reality. what you're missing are the businesses that never receive funding. the good idea that the markets want that never receive funding and jobs never created because we're funding ideas that you like with the money of others. >> rich, have you ever seen these kind of programs work at all? i moon, youngstown, ohio or anywhere else? >> you know, i think liberals like rick always go back to the 1930s when it seemed like all these wpa projects worked, but we had a different environment then. we didn't have public sector unions. we didn't have all these regulatory barriers. the problem is that the things that rick talks about are so much more expensive whenadministered by the government than they would be by the private sector. >> you got ten seconds, wrap it up. >> working today! it's 20 and. it's working now. it's -- >> no it's not. >> it's also working in flint, michigan, this exact program. it's bringing business in. doing all the things you like. >> we got to wrap it up at that. coming up, mountain dew. as your life and career change, fidelity is there for your personal economy, helping you readjust your retirement plan along the way. rethink how you're invested. and refocus as your career moves forward. wherever you are today, a fidelity ira has a wide range of investment choices to help you fine-tune your personal economy. call today and we'll make it easy to move that old 401(k) to a fidelity no-fee ira.>> we are back. mountain dew just releasing its breakfast drink. why do you like it? >> return fund i own it. up 19% last year. it's a little pricey, but there are smart guys that go to cash when they need to n morgan? >> thumbs up. this is a great option. but the holdings can be volatile. >> you like james smocker? >> i do. they had a solid earnings report. analysts have been"

at the russian airport where he has been holed up for the last six years. and he told them he was renewing his request for asylum in russia until he can get to latin america. the geeky sneak. they put out a statement through wikileaks accusing america and some european countries of acting extra legally to prevent him from taking sank sue water in -- sanctuary in places like venezuela.he showed no regret saying i did what i believed right and began a campaign to correct the wrong wrongdoing. i did not seek to enrich myself or seek to sell u.s. secrets. in the tele prompter you need to put periods there. i did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety. i have no regrets. it is like a mariah carey song. meanwhile, another standoff equally as important is under way. >> we are going to be following this closely throughout the show. we've got live cameramen there. i think greta is actually on scene. i'm sure we will go to her live. it may be an hour of greta. >> she has an exclusive with the terrier. >> the turtle is not talking.he has been in his shell for quite awhile. ladies and gentlemen, animal humor. anthony, if you can blink your eyes and had magical power and could create your desired outcome for snowden, what would it be? >> i don't know. i don't know if he is a good guy or bad guy at this point. all right, that sounds good. and then somebody else says something else and i try to get my opinion from other newschannels, but they are yelling at the top of their lungs about a trial, so i don't know what is going on. i can only take care of one catastrophe at a time. >> you are so right. the whole definition of the zimmerman trial is somebody reads an article in the morning and then yells about it. >> all day long. >> at least this snowden thing there are actually two sides that you can argue about, and then you can change the facts. but you can't change the facts if you don't know the facts. a lot of people claim this guy is a hero, the guy being snowden. what about you? i have not heard much from you about this. >> i'm with anthony, with amnesty in the zimmerman trial.i seriously don't know whose side i'm on in that. but if he has done something bad, i think spending the rest of his life in venezuela is punishment enough. >> that's true. all they can do is watch sean penn movies apparently because they are fans. >> it is like jerry lewis in france. >> he is like the jerry lewis of venezuela. that's so true. he is the david hasselhoff of germany. i was going to say of that smaller country down south. >> columbia? >> yes. i don't know anymore. what say you? you have been involved in intelligence for many years. our administration is leaning heavily on latin american countries not to give snowden asylum. >> it hurts his case. to leave the u.s. for russia for press freedom is like leaving your slightly rude boyfriend to join your ax murdering husband. it is like going to the whole next level. putin, journalists disappear there all the time routinely. there are problems with press freedom. we will know if he has gonenative or not, as we say in my business if he is next to putin with a track suit that is wide open. thenal we will know -- then we will know whose side she on. >> he will be shirtless cuddling a bear cub. do you think he will end up staying in russia? >> i think he will end up in one of the warmer, but equally autocratic countries down south. and i don't think the u.s. will get -- this will be like in the old cold war days. there are a bunch of brits. they go live and russia and then were never heard from again. they live out their days. >> in a rare show of solidarity, every country on earth offered you asylum as long as you arrived in 13 pieces. >> how is that even possible unless i -- wait. that's no good. i love the phrase, i have no regrets. i have no regrets. he has been living under the russian equivalent in some nameless terminal for the past month.yes it is good if he is nursing an energy bar and sitting in his own fillet. that disgusts me. i will say that he is a pro. when you were talking about the relentless zimmerman coverage you said other networks. he'll be back. >> i just didn't want to have to name them all. >> there are so many of them. >> fox news has offered a fair and balanced approach to everything. we were covering all sorts of things. today i covered justin bieber for two minutes. it was fantastic. here is my solution. this is brilliant. i think we should encourage asylum for snowden. whatever country picks him you send a jumbo jet filled with the gitmo inmates with parachutes. so say it is venezuela or wherever and then you push all of the gitmo inmates out into that country. no country should have a choice of who they grant asylum to if the people they are granting asylum to is a threat to us. it should be everybody. >> did you follow all of that? >> i like it. >> and i would love for onceone of your wacky ideas to come to fruition. they never do. that's a good one. >> we have snowden and then you have 250 guys that are terrorists and then you say, okay, this is what we have to worry about as a major power. we have to worry about these terrorists. you don't. that's why you can give asylum to this guy. you don't have to worry about this guy. >> russia had a lot of terrorism. >> from the islamic extremists. >> when you think about it snowden and his information is like the aggressive turtle. right now america is the terrier and the terrier is waging its tale and hoping -- tail and hoping it is over. they keep coming at him and the terrier is backing up like what? and he will be like, i have canine and i'm coming at you, turtle and guess where the asylum is. >> i also think putin is really enjoying this. he is even saying we will only give you amnesty if he stops hurting america.he loves hurting america. he is rubbing it in our faces. it is like a mofia guy going -- >> by the way it is like a smirnonf. >> i like how he completely ignored what bill said. >> he is learning because he is on the show. >> from leakers to looters. a new app asks users to reveal the home address of gun owners they consider potentially unsafe in order to arm the world with the important info. the gun geo marker app available now at google's app store -- all of these new phrases scare me. it encourages weapon wearing winies to mark the homes and businesses of, quote, suspected it unsafe gun owners to help others in the area learn about their geography of reask from gun accidents or violence. and like when a new york newspaper published addresses in january response has been universally positive.for example, this is dangerous because it allows criminals to determine where they might steal the firearms. and another, major violation of privacy could cause safety issue for nongun owners. so true. meanwhile, i understand there was a development in another story we have been following. >> i'm telling you, you know what this is. they are acting out the whole conflict of gay marriage. the turtle being the desire for gay marriage and the snauzer saying i am not ready for it. and the turtle is in his shell protected by the tolerance of liberal society and the snauzer is like, give me some time. i need to work through issues. >> you never get the subtle tees. >> you know how they have body experts on owe riley who make no sense at all?they come on and they go, oh that person is upset because the person is crying. bill, i think the frown means sad. >> judge napolitano is laughing right now because he heard something humorous. >> the best one i ever saw was actual. she asked the body expert why she was doing this with her hair and the body expert said i think her hair was in her eyes. let's get away from trashing the number one cable show in america. and anthony, i'm going to you for no particular reason. perhaps because you own 1700 guns. if your home was marked by the app user, would you care or embrace it? >> first of all i don't care. i actually use it as a system to my house. >> the biggest glowing reddot. >> no, i don't care. here is the deal. i know a lot of people are afraid. my guns are all locked up very secure except for the one i keep on my hip. if someone wants to break in and get to it, i will get to mine first. >> will you give them five seconds? >> yeah, one, two, three. >> see i thought when you said were you a fan of the head start program -- >> no. you know what, it is stupid and intrusive. it is spiteful. i think it is more dangerous to those people who don't show up on these things. >> nongun owners are more unsafe because criminals know the places to rob. that's the way it is going to work. that makes sense. the people that make this app, i think they believe all gun owners are unsafe whether they are criminals or not. >> i think it shows how much the left hates guns if they are willing to make an appthey should call burglarize me. it is pointing out which houses and it is not just about stealing people's guns. it is which houses you can go into. and they will not have a gun in this house. you can find out easily who has weapons and who doesn't. >> and you would think criminals aren't that smart. you think they are going to break. if they know there is a gun in one house and not in another, they are not going to go. >> how many regular break in burglars know what an app is or a google app. >> i am so terrified. these computer nerds are breaking into my house. no, no. i just love that this is in the era of obama and we are now snitching on one another. who would even think of doing something like that? >> the whole big brother pair no i yaw, we -- paranoia we thought the government would come and put cameras up, but it is us. >> the people that made the 1984 movie rtz ones that --movies are the ones that want this. >> it is the transparency to see. >> i want to ask bill a question. this is an interesting fact. google has an app called where to find bill schulz and shoot him in the face. it is number one. it is number one bill. >> he is so mean to you. poor bill. >> thank you, anne. >> and much like the bullet i saw that one coming. >> you have a head start policy when they come in, and then you start tw -- you start with the head. with your scope it is over quickly. luckily he has a made. i don't see why anybody has a problem with that. it is not just gun owners. it is irresponsible gun owners. if you are not going to one place you are definitely not going to the person who is the irresponsible gun owner. >> or you know they will really slow down and make itlast. >> and what is the criteria for irresponsible gun owner. they are going to judge what irresponsible is? >> if i was a nongun owner and i got robbed i would sue this app. i would sue the -- if they found out they had the app i would sue them. they found out i didn't have a gun by using this app i am suing google for that particular information. >> i would load up the terrorists and drop it on their building. >> i would report myself as an irresponsible gun owner. >> that sounds scare yes, sir. the responsible gun owner would give uh warning shot. he probably even has more than seven rounds in his magazine. >> very nervous. >> this is an important story from an app to crap. it had buzz on twitter, but ratings were in the toilet on thursday night, sci-fi channel aired shark nato, the purposely cheesy film abouttornadoes filled with sharks, hence the name, with ian zering and tara reid. the initter net went nuts about the movie. people sending 5,000 tweets a minute. let's do the math. just kidding. it turns out shark nato may have been more talked about than seen with nielsen. reporting the overnight ratings for what may well be the best movie ever played -- ever made were blah. the film pulled around 1.4 million viewers and managed a 4.55 rating. that's a tv slogan for nah. the network has talks of a sequel underway and production continuing.>> i don't even know what to do after that. it has zapped me of all energy. >> it was less cute when the shark nato stopped by. >> that might have been the most adorable thing i have seen in my life and it is making my hands wrinkle arthritically. does twitter ultimately not matter? it has no affect on the ratings of such a great movie? >> there are not enough people tweeting. i don't know what the ratings were going to have to be. there were a million people watching it, but this is going to be a cult classic. that's what everybody has to understand. it is not like everybody has to watch this at once. they will continue to watch in the future. this is continuing the future of snakes on a plane. a fantastic movie. it is one of samuel l jackson's finest moments in my opinion. >> i miss, and anybody over 40 knows what i am talking about, movies like pray for the wild cats where andy griffin terrorized hippies or bad ronald, the guy who lives in the walls. his family dies and he lives in the walls.they were every monday night on abc, movie of the week. don't have a question, anne. there is a disconnect between twitter and mainstream media mean obama should be impeached? >> the lo question confirmed the point i wanted to make. i noticed in the story that the first tweet quoted was by our own greg gutfeld. so you are doing the bill o'reilly thing of covering all news about yourself. two, i think while it sounds like you have a very exciting life, i think you should have a drink with us tonight. >> you are trying to get me out and get drunk because i haven't been going out lately. >> she makes a mean shark nato. >> you were watching it because i was watching your tweets. >> i was doing -- actually i was tweeting two things. it was the zimmerman trial and that. at one point i tweeted justice for shark nato. it was confusing to a lot ofpeople. >> bill, the ratings for shark nato make me ashamed to be an american which is how you feel every day. >> at least you called me an american. deal with it, other americans. i am here to stay. >> you know what i think, here is what i think. it is the godfather of short tornado films. it blew jaws out of the water. my fish had his aquarium on all night. >> ian zering's best work since 90210. >> and tara reid, fantastic. >> he besmirches the shark. >> no one is bringing up the fact that robbie risk who played oliver on ""the brady bunch"" was the bus driver. >> no! >> yes, he was. >> i am flipping this table over. >> now i think you are all dorks. >> do i have time? coming up, how can we fix america? ann coulter discusses her newbook, i sleep on a bed of lies before i tear them limb from limb. it is important to get your rest. the running of the bulls. that's it. running of the bulls.should we be forlorn because they got the horn? a -- an american and two spaniards, human, not dogs, were gored during the running of the bulls event. they were running through the city streets while three others were strap pelled. the torso tossing was captured by tv crews while others attempted to distract the beast by cairn -- seranadingthem. >> you have to be bleeped. you bleeped me on that. >> the warning. i have to make a warning to these people. the following footage is graphic and sensitive viewers are encouraged to crawl up close to the screen to get a better look. >> you thought there was going to be a kitten video, didn't you? >> by the way, these people do this -- this is what they expect. 50 people have been killed since they started keeping records. speaking up, more important matters, the standoff.>> see that to me is so much more interesting than the running of the bulls. what you have got there is a real challenge. you have a turtle, slow, but with a shell. you have a dog, no shell, but faster and he has a bark. you can see who is winning that. the turtle is winning. it is because he is a turtle. why do the people do the running of the bulls? >> i completely agree with what you said. ii wanted you to come to me first. anyone who claims to have run with the bulls is a complete and i'm running through you it in my head the words i am allowed to say on the show. a coward who would stay home at nightwatching shark nato. i have been there and you stand there watching literally for half an hour. the whole run is five minutes. 19thine .9% of the people running with the bulls are out having a drink or theirmorning coffee before the bulls have been let go. >> it is like smoking a cigarette. >> and the last ones are complete, drunk imbeciles like we just saw. >> buck, you want something? >> i went riding donkeys in cairo. >> i saw the film. >> this is the only way you can ride an ass and have the epg. totally true and allowed to say that because it was one. but safer because there were no horns. >> anthony, you are always armed. would a gun make running with the bulls less scary? >> a gun makes everything less scary, greg. i think with the advent of the internet running of the bulls -- i can go to world star hip hop and see so much more brutal stuff than a bull goring. how do the big animals know that taking a guy's pants off makes it so much worse? it is so embarrassing. and they always know. >> they always know to takethe pants off. do you think the guys loosen their pants to add a little flirtation with the bulls? >> wouldn't you wear shorts? isn't speed of the essence? why are you wearing jeans? >> when i watch this i think it is a cruel sport. you are tawpting an an -- taunting an animal and then when the animal gets you, then all of a sudden everybody starts bugging you more. it bothers me, bill. you like the chicago bulls and i tried to pay the team to trample you until you died. three were up for it -- they were up for it and then they said you know what? you don't have to pay it. >> the ball will belong to you. >> 15 people have died since they started keeping records in 1911. this is safest thing in the history of the world. more people die crossing park avenue drunk at 2:00 a.m. every night and spending the entire history. the reason we don't see a lotof this footage is most of the time the bulls are half drugged by whatever thing they give them. they have corked on both of their horns and nothing ever happens. this is much a do about something. >> see, you didn't think i was going to say that. >> you know, your word play never amazes me. >> sometimes i feel like it is word works. >> maybe you should take some time off. >> a word vacation. >> no, just leave. >> if i stop being mean to bill, our ratings plummet. we have noticed a trend. the meaner i am -- the nicer i am they just drop. >> you can see a blip every time he calls me d bag. >> coming up, standard and poors has upgraded the credit outlook. they argue the country's debt are falling faster than expected. not doing that story.the man who invented twister and a nation mourns, or not. they could just be drunk like me. oh look where he is going.>> i don't know. he is on a big colorful mass in the sky. the guy who got us on the floor is with us no more. the genius behind twister has died at the age of 82. in the mid60s he and apartner were hired by a manufacturing firm that wanted to expand into games and toys. he said, quote, dad wanted to make a game that could light up a party. they originally called it pretzel. a great name and a nice snack. they sold it to milton bradley who came up with a twister name. anyway. foley made little money because he sold it. then he went on to invent many other products including fire. discuss shall we in the -- >> lightning round. lightning round. >> it gets longer every time. >> it feels that way. i answered yes on different occasions. >> it kills air time. >> a, have you ever played twister? and if not what was your favorite board game or game growing up? >> i'm sure we played twister. >> i'm sure is not yes or no.>> it was mostly outside. the only thing i don't understand in the story is i don't see you mentioned in it. this is a really boring story. >> did you see the last quote? greg gutfeld tweeted. >> i think in next week's water's world they played twister with some strippers with his collar up. >> with funny movies. >> anthony, self-generations of awkward teen age boys including myself have this guy to thank for getting close to girls because of the game. >> that's why it is a story. >> that's the illusion and the fantasy. usually you are on a dumb mat with some of your friends and your own sister. it was never this oh we can get this girl and do this and -- it never ended up that way. mom comes in and wants to play.>> how much do you want to bet the twister was the game that made you find out you were gay. you were playing at camp and you go jeesh i never felt this way before about bob. >> a little trivia? that's where the rainbow came from, from the twister game. >> that's any pif knee -- that's an epiphany. the twister helped you decide what your orientation was. why am i on the show when i should be running a country or a college? i love twister. i had three older sisters who had their friends come over. i watched them play all the time. you can't play twister on an ipad. you can't play twister on a computer. >> you can, but it is only with your finger. >> and for a lonely man. >> i have always wondered when they pitched this game initially they were like, i have an idea. it is where a bunch of people stretch awkwardly over everybody's bodies. it is like, we have thatgame. it is called pro creation. >> this was a test for parents to see if their children went one way or the ear. one way or the other. it was a genius idea. >> creating human life was not game. if only some of our nation's teams didn't look at it that way. >> bill, thanks for the psa. >> you are welcome. >> bill, you still play twister nude for the amusement of older gentlemen. it is cd clubs where they pelt you with garbage and laugh as you cry. >> up until now i didn't realize they had a name. i didn't notice the pad on the floor. >> i still have the vision of your diser and her friend -- your sister and her friend playing twister and you are in the corner in your osh-kosh osh-kosh-bgosh going -- >> i was born in 1964 and there was no whatever you said. 1969, 1971 around that area.on my block there were about a thousand girls that lived on that block. they all played twister. >> that's why we are doing this story. >> twister was a great, great game. i should probably just move along to the next story. there were disappearances of certain neighbors afterwards. >> but we can't get into it now.   next topic, the website list verse.com where i get all of my news released the 10 greatest syndicated comic strips of all time. topping the list was calvin and hobbs. it is about a six-year-old boy and his stuffed tiger which is based on a true story. rounding it out was pogo, far side, peanuts and the view. wow. i always thought barbara was hilarious. i go to you first because i can't think of a question. is there something missing from the list? >> i mean, it is not exactly a cartoon, but i hate to soundlike i watched shark nato, but the best cartoons are from the new yorker. a lot are the same cartoonists. i strongly object to dunesbury being on a list of the top 1,000. >> dunesbury is the beneficiary of comic book welfare. not funny, but because he agreed with the assumptions of the newspaper editors he got a spot. there has never been a funny one. >> it is like nation magazine humor. >> you are just jealous because you don't get to have sex with jane pauly. >> i would read it and be mad. first of all i don't even understand it. and i don't think it was because i was stupid. i was stupid, but that wasn't the reason. >> is it the far side one where it says pull and he is pushing and it is for the school for the gifted? that made me feel bad every time i see that. >> that is the classic one. >> the show i don't like --the comic strip i didn't like was andy kapp. he was taking a nap or beating his wife. >> always drinking. >> he was always drinking and napping and scaring the crap out of his wife. and you love brenda star. >> i tried to be brenda star. that's how i got into journalism. the natural hair color is coming back. i was a red head. i hated when andy would break into the halfway house his wife was hiding out in. you know how he described himself? put so a different cap. >> wasn't he british? >> i think he was british. >> the stereo type of the brits being a drunk. >> and then you had to read his accent. it is archaic. >> people back then were not funny. you ever watch old funny stuff? not funny. >> it was a great cartoon though. running around the house.   more stuff when we comeback. ""joy of hate"" am amazon.com. autographed copy. if you buy one copy of ""joy of hate"" right now you can buy another one for the same exact price.>> oh stop it. should you escape or gesticulate? a guy had an encounter with a 300-pound bear. the reporter covering the story offered tips on what to do in a face down with a big beast that is big and brown. it may be the greatest thing on tv news since he almost killed that kid. >> according to experts you should avoid direct eye contact with the bear. don't run away. instead back off slowly. waive your arms to let the animal know you are human. don't yell and stay quiet unless the bear attacks and then if it does scream and throw things. curl up on a ball on your sideor lay on your stomach and above all, stay calm. >> outstanding. sadly she got hit by a bus right after that. have you ever seen such informative reporting? >> it was fantastic. i would tiewltly use -- i would actually use those strategies if she came up to me in a bar. if she is just not the wing man of a bar. >> the eye movement is great. >> we have to leave. we have to go home. >> anne, thoughts? will she be working for ""60 minutes""? >> in order to give you my thoughts i need to see it again. >> i love this woman. she is fantastic. come on. there you go. you can't make eye contact. >> it looks like she is watching us play ping-pong. >> she is going get away fruit flies. shut up, quiet.i am about to pass wind. >> the worst twerking video i have ever seen. >> taking a nap. >> i can watch that all night. >> i think she did a great job. >> i think she did a pretty good job. i love the conception that when the bear knows you are human it is like, whoa, my bad. you are a human? i saw you and totally thought you were some other mammal and now i know it is time to leave you alone. it is a public safety announcement and very important stuff. >> unlike her you welcome bears to ravage your rail thin body. >> waiting. we talked about this. it is only a question if there is an inflection. i like this girl. i thank her for this animated video, but you know she is a pain to work with. she is the one that remembers everyone's birthdays and super quick with the joke. everyone else is hung over inthe office and she is a ray of sunshine and tells everybody about the amazing book club the year before. >> have you literally worked with her? >> i am her. >> what is her name? >> post game report, andy levy.tv's an disee levey with the post game report. >> i wanted to give a little thanks and they had their all time greatest issue. they put me on one of their lists. i came in seventh on the best late night fake ambudsman. >> seventh? >> yes. >> who beat you? >> the top six slots were blank. >> what? >> still a great honor. >> you have to shoot for something. you were shooting for blanks. >> greg, you mentioned that they accused the u.s. of acting extra legally. it is not just legally, it is extra legally. >> it is not like you are breaking the law. you are doing a lot of the law. >> you are really acting legally. you are acting extra legally. >> you see a cop go by and youare wasted. >> it is super normal. >> officer, great job. >> and you don't have an opinion on this on snowden. >> i didn't have an opinion on twister. >> and two equally important stories. >> on ""red eye"" one is more important. >> i am a little upset we didn't lead on twister. >> one man is bringing this country down to his knees and the game brings everybody to their knees. there is a trend here. >> you said it hurts snowden's case to leave the u.s. and go to russia for press freedom, but that's not why he went to russia and not why he will end up in venezuela is it? >> you are being rational about this.this is true of all of these guys that are like we are about radical trans paren see, except from countries that will bundle up into a ball and stick us into a dark hole, china, russia. when wikileaks and these guys start publishing for them, give them a high five. >> i completely agree about wikileaks. it is more anti-american than anything. >> they hate america. >> i agree. i think snowden was, look, he could have stayed and got a trial or he had to go to a country that we don't have great relations with which means it will be one of those countries. >> in the old days when you sold out your country you took your cyanide pill like a man. come on. you don't need an umbrella drink. this is nonsense. >> you don't seem to buy snowden's statement that he gives no regrets given he is stuck in an air port. you can't imagine the self-sacrifice for a larger good. greg you said today you covered justin bieber for twominutes. was that how long it took for his bodyguards to get you off of him. >> i am just trying to help him out. >> how does he smell by the way? >> he smells like summer dreams and honey suck kill. honeysuckle. >> and athletes expose the address of gun owners. i enjoy the o'reilly factor as i do all the segments. >> anthony, the maker of the app is now complaining that gun owners are spamming it. they are posting false markers for addresses where the sewners of the house don't have guns. that's the perfect response to this, isn't it? >> i guess so, but i hate the thought of people getting credit for having guns when they really don't. >> anne, did you say you would just put your address on it?>> as in the irresponsible gun owner if i were a person without a gun. >> this can become a competition. they said look if you are marking my house with a gun i want it to be really good. are they going to put revolvers on them? >> and each have a responsible use for it. >> shark nato ratings don't equal twitter excitement. you said this will be a cold classic. they are on their way. sci-fi announced they hillary air it next thursday. it is another chance for you, america. >> it is going to be fantastic. and we missed the possibility of bear plus hurricane equals barricane. >> i saw that on twitter like 800 times. >> you know what my idea was? dogs and left over rain. the poodle puddle. >> running of the bulls with a tornado, a gornado.that's fore play. you have to rhyme it. >> awful. >> all of these were done to death on twitter. stop. >> you don't see every tweet, andy. >> i do rchlt. tara reid tells the tv news she is up for doing the sequel. by the way, we drew 1.4 million. in 2010 the movie sharktapus drew 4.5 million. but that had the advantage of being a true story. >> that's true. you know what an andy nato is? he gets home from work and goes to his apartment and takes off his shirt and turns on the fans and grabs his hats and does cart wheels. >> sounds adorable. >> i thought i got all of the cameras out. three gored in running of the bulls. you started to say they deserve this and then backedoff. you hospital have. gash -- you shouldn't have. >> i am a human and i feel bad for the bulls. if you are taking the risk, you are assuming the risk. >> as a knicks fan it is hard to say this, but go bulls. you have to know how it makes it funnier. if you watch closely though, you scan see he had his belt unbuckled and belt undone. no, look what the bull did. oh no! bill they do not put corks on the tips of the horns. >> you don't know that. >> in bugs bunny cartoons. >> the inventor of twitter died. foley invented fire? >> yes jie. oh, twister. that is untrue. and he made a grand total of $27,000 for twister. >> milton bradley ripped everybody off. >> hasbro did and then they sold to milton bradley jie. itwas more like has-no. why am i trying at this point?

responsibility. what's your policy? >> thanks for joining us, ""america live"" starts right now. >> megyn: and we begin with a fox news alert for you. with just hours to go before the first state of the union of president obama's second term, we're getting new details about the key focus of his prime time address to the nation tonight. welcome to america live, everyone, i'm alisyn camerota in for megyn kelly. and amid a recent string of economic concerns, the national unemployment rate just recently ticked up to 7.9%. consumer confidence has dropped to its lowest level in a year for the first time since the recession ended, the economy actually contracted,also, gasoline prices are unexpectedly spiking. the national average now at 3.60. 19 states have prices that are higher than that. stuart varney is the anchor of varney and company on the fox business network. he joins me now, hi, stu. >> alisyn. >> what are we expecting the president to say about the economy? >> a lot of what he will say has been leaked at least a broad outline and call for a more robust government presence in the economy and saying government and government spending which will rebuild the middle class. he won't call it government spending, he will call it investing and three areas in particular where the president wants to raise the spending level, invest more. they are education, green energy, and infrastructure. he wants to raise the level of spending in those three areas, that he believes, will create jobs. all of this will be partly paid for by raising the amount of money that the government takes from wealthy individuals, raising the amount of money that it takesfrom corporations and getting more money out of oil companies. overall, alisyn, it will ab fairly aggressive pursuit of the same policies we've been seeing for the last four years, for the next four years. he'll be aggressive this year. >> critics will say this new term, investment in the future is a synonym for stimulus. is there an argument to be made that the white house, i imagine, will make that stimulus was short-term, investments in the future are long-term in terms of highway projects and rebuilding schools for decades to come? >> speaker pelosi, former speaker pelosi in her appearance with chris wall lost on fox news sunday, said that investing in education was the best thing for the economy, brings in more money to the treasury. that may or may not be true. it may be true in the long-term, but that is the white house, that is miss pelosi's response to the accusation that stimulus is short-term, didn't work verywell last time around. no, this time we're going for investing over the long-term. the president thinks that more government spending will produce more middle chas jobs short-term. that has been a yet to be proven theory. it didn't work in the has four years. the president will kind of double down tonight and hope that it will work better in the next four years. >> and how will that work? is that about building roads and bridges? i mean, is this about creating jobs because of massive infrastructure projects? >> yes, that is the broad outline. we don't know the specifics, we don't know how much more in infrastructure, how much more in education or green energy, but there will be more spending in those areas. the thing that troubles a lot of people is that we're settling for the mediocre, we're settling for okay, we're going in the right direction, but not fast enough. 2% growth if we achieve that this year and the government has been we will not achievethat this year. 2% growth is just not good enough. you do not restore jobs and prosperity to america with a 2% growth rate. a lot of people are saying, look, we must not settle for the mediocre, we must go for america and always has been, a robust, a high growth society. >> stuart, let me show you a couple of new gallop polls that have just come out which show how the public feels about the president. the first question, how do you feel about the handling of the economy by president obama? 39% approve while 60% disapprove of his handling of the economy. what do you make of that? >> i think the president is going to go over the heads of congress tonight and go straight to the people to repeat his case. follow me, follow government spending, follow my policies and we will achieve more growth. we've just got to give it more time. i think that's what he's going to say, because, obviously,'s' ignoring that kind of an opinion poll you just quoted,alisyn. >> stu varney, thanks for your analysis on this. a little more context of those spiking gasoline prices that we talked about. let's talk about this chart, the blue line represents last year and the redline this year. so you can see the price started out about the same in both years, but this year, gasoline has risen much faster and higher than the year before. in january, the national average was $3.32. now we're at $3.60 a gallon. and prices have gone up for 26 consecutive days now and it's now the highest ever for this time of year. we'll see if the president addresses some of this tonight and more. the special coverage begins at 8:55 p.m. eastern right here on the fox news channel. and we have another developing story from washington for you right now and this could become a very big deal in the coming days. democrats accused of an ugly double standard. now, the republicans have raised concerns about cayman island bank accounts. one held by jack lu thepresident's pick to be our next treasury secretary. and democrats blasted mitt romney for having money for overseas account. check out this campaign ad from team obama. >> hi, i'm the national press secretary in obama for america. on tuesday ""vanity fair"" published an article on the millions of dollars that mitt romney had in tax havens like the bermuda and cayman islands. did he put money there to avoid paying taxes, we don't know he won't release tax returns. >> it may put lew's nomination in jeopardy. very unusual for a cabinet pick. and joining us live from capitol hill. doug, what do we know. >> reporter: and they say that jack lew has been confirmed in various posts and no reason why he shouldn't be again. republicans beg to differ and mounting sentiment hisnomination for treasury secretary may be blocked. at the heart of his trouble. a cayman island investment for citigroup. and while they say that lew paid all taxes associated with that account president obama has repeatedly criticized off shore accounts as you just saw during the campaign of 2012, mitt romney's investments in such an account. leading the charge against lew up here is ranking member jeff sessions of alabama and he also criticizes lew for being the architect of two failed obama budgets which garnered absolutely zero votes up here in the senate, sessions says, quote, he made a series of outrageously false statements about these plans to congress and the american people. and mr. lew's budget and egregious disregard for the truth for fiscal reform and in so doing placed this nation and its citizens in financial danger. these actions alone are disqualifies and sessionsthreatened this just last night, listen up. >> with cabinet people we try not to do that almost done ever in the senate, but this is a big deal. >> reporter: lew was the chief operating officer of citigroup from 2006-2008. citigroup was the largest recipient of any banking institution of bailout money, almost half a trillion dollars, that no doubt will come under tremendous scrutiny as jack lew's confirmation hearing for treasury secretary gets underway here. >> all right. doug, thanks for that. new revelations to track down that ex-lapd officer going on a killing rampage, gunned down at least three people allegedly for retaliation for being fired from the lapd back in 2009. well, now we're learning that dorner was seen purchasingscuba equipment just two days before the murders and that he may also be capable of flying a plane. trace gallagher is live for us from los angeles. what have you learned, trace? >> reporter: that's the reason that all the southern california airports have been put on alert and you have to go back to the scuba gear and how it fit into the plan. he was seen buying the scuba gear two days before the first murder at the sporting goods store in torrence, south of los angeles courtesy of our friends at tmz. he did train in undersea warfare with the navy and clearly knows how to dive and police say he tried to steal a boat in san diego, telling the boat owner that he could pick it up in mexico. but a rope got stuck in the propeller and he had to flee the scene. but on a boat, scuba gear suddenly becomes handy especially if you plan to ditch in open water. now the time line of this whole thing is changing. listen to what lapd chiefcharlie beck said about the stolen boat or at least the attempt a few days ago. listen. >> wednesday, february 6th, about 8:30 p.m., in san diego, an attempt robbery boat theft. dorner attempt today steal a boat from a boat owner in san diego. he was not successful and fled the location. >> reporter: did you hear him say 8:30 he later changed that to 10:30 p.m. which means he tried to steal the boat, failed and went to shoot three police officers and then apparently fled to big bear and now the marshal's affidavit says the boat attempt was at three o'clock in the morning, an hour and a half after the police officers were shot. his wallet was then later found where you see right here at the border crossing between tijuana and san diego. hours later was when the burned out truck was found in big bear. days later there is still no sign of christopher dorner in big bear, but there's now a belief that he might possibly be in mexico, in fact, therewas a raid today at the tijuana hotel and that turned up nothing. the entire time line now changing alisyn and there's still no sign anywhereof that man, christopher doren. >> wow, it sounds like a needle in a haystack search, we'll talk with investigators later in the program where they go next, thanks, trace. the testing of a nuclear bomb is sending shock waves across the globe. how close north korea might be to putting a nuclear warhead on top of a missile. the american hero to red the world of osama bin

>> by not giving them food. alis alisyn, look, i don't want anybody starving, i don't like this, but we americans think there's always a good solutionif we can only figure it out. in the real world there's only less bad solutions some of the times and frankly, if we keep feeding north korea, and if china, especially, keeps propping it up, then the north koreans eventually are going to do something really stupid. the great danger here is that the north korean leadership. they live on another planet. their logic is different and the great danger is all of us misunderstanding one another and tumbling head long into a devastating war on the korean peninsula, i stress on the korean peninsula. >> alisyn: lt. colonel ralph peters, thank you so much. >> my pleasure, alisyn. >> alisyn: the president is expected to add more things to the state of the union address, and tomorrow, the president is also going to add a growing list of executive orders on everything from immigration to gun control, to same sex marriage. judge andrew napolitano says there's a serious problem getting larger here. he's going to be with us live and explain all of that. and texas governor rick perryis riding into california, offering local business a chance to find a new home on the range in texas. a place where he says taxes are low and profits are high, that story is next.

>> more snow tomorrow night, basically into thursday morning and also looking at a possibility for another nor'easter as we head into this weekend. so, we're looking at two storms that could be bringing in more snow. the good news about the storm tomorrow night it's going to stay relatively weak. if you live in manhattan. two to four inches of snow and that's pretty much the story for people in long island and also into parts of connecticut and southern portions of new england. not too bad, but the storm right now is already producing big time headaches across portions of the southeast. we do have very heavy rain falling across portions of georgia, alabama, mississippi and we do have a flash flood threat out here with a number of watches in effect and a severe weather threat in the form of tornados, damaging wind gusts and large hail from southern georgia, the florida panhandle and westward into the city of new orleans and you could also be seeing that possibility for severe weather today. there's a winter side of the storm developing across the texas panhandle and oklahomaand talking anywhere between 8 to 12 inches of snow and a maximum amount and factoring in the wind and white-out conditions on the he roadways. this is a computer model, ali. look at it as we head into 9 a.m. wednesday and the center will be off shore of new york city, again, just light amounts and yes, more snow coming up wednesday night into thursday morning. >> all right, maria molina thanks so much for at that warning. warning. >> i know a lot of doctors, i work with a lot of doctors i didn't find a lot of support for it. i found a lot of people who were really quite disappointed. >> and what bothered them, doctor? what was it that caused them the greatest concern? >> well, first of all, it's an expansion of the bureaucracy. you know, what do you need for good health care? you need a patient and you need a doctor. along comes the middle man to facilitate the relationship and it has become this mammothcreature that completely controls everything. >> alisyn: that was dr. benjamin carson of johns hopkins university appearing on fox news channel, your world with neil cavuto. he made headlines for knocking the president's health care laws at the national prayer breakfast and shined the light on the problem on the first state that tried to implement the law. california realizes it does not have nearly enough doctors to handle the influx of new patients. according to the l.a. times, only 16 of the state's 58 counties even meet the federal government's recommended standard for number of doctors. what's more, almost 30% of california's doctors close to retirement age and that has some suggesting that the state expand the definition of doctor to allow nurse practitioners, pharmacists and optometrists to act as primary care physicians. let's debate this. a syndicated radio talk show host and fox news contributor,and welcome to the show both of you. >> hi, good morning. >> chris, are you comfortable with your pharmacist giving you your full exam next time you go into cvs? >> this is just classic big government tripping all over itself to try to correct their last error, isn't it? now we've got what, the cuban model, venezuelan model for medicine in america. no, no i am he' not. no, i like going to a doctor. that's the way that i grew up, call me a spoiled american, but california once again, the condor in the coal mine is leading the way. they're showing us this debacle of a health care bill is going to create more problems nan it solves and they're coming up with solutions that are not solutions at all, that are just going to make matters worse and kind of third world our health care system, as it were. >> alisyn: leslie, it's not like we didn't know this was a possibility. i remember doctors on fox news, our medical a-team warning that with the influx of new patients that we see with the affordable care act,aka obamacare that we would have a doctor shortage and sure enough now it's happening. >> actually statistically, you're right, but long before actually president obama was the president, my husband's an orthopedic surgeon, i co-own a medical center. know a lot about this one, guys, and i live in california, chris, you don't have to come out here. i would agree with chris, i don't want my pharmacist giving me medical information, but almost every woman out there can nod your head how many times does is nurse practitioner or a pa drawn blood or done a pap smear. there are already people in doctor's offices assisting physicians in the the manner that they should. that being said, we did not look at the number of retirees. january 1st of this year-- excuse me, last year, 10,000 people a day for the next 19 years entering medicare. people crowding the emergency rooms, hospitals having to merge, they don't have enough staff. and emergency rooms and hospitals closing down. this is why, quite frankly,the affordable care act didn't go far enough. and when you look at doctors reimbursements being cut not only by the federal government, by the private sector, absolutely no caps on medical malpractice, now you're going to get to sue your nurse practitioners and pa's and pharmacists and chris, i agree it's not the answer and don't blame it on the affordable care act. this was a perfect storm about to happen. >> alisyn: chris, do you agree it mass nothing to do with the affordable care act, this is in fact what obamacare was designed to try to stave off all of the sort of ominous picture that leslie was pointing out? >> no, you'll be surprised to learn that i don't agree. i love california, i lived in california for seven years in santa barbara, a great state, too bad it's falling into the ocean because of insane leadership. no, look, you just articulated the problem and in a new way, and that is that, you know, it wasn't anticipated that we're going to have all of these doctors retiring, 30% orsomething of doctors in california retiring, he so the problem is going to get worse and worse, but we knew the population was aging, one of the reasonsway wanted to take this on. kind of a major oversight in the scheme of things i've got to say if we've already got health care practitioners and various medical offices performing these tasks, that means they're in critical mass. the solution is not to throw more patients at the number of the small number, the inadequate number of health care providers that we have. >> yeah. >> and in fact, that there is no solution. obamacare is responsible for this. obamacare was supposed to be the cure for this, the remedy for this, the fix for this. and it's not only not the fix for it, it exacerbates and compounds not just the central problem, but the microproblems along with it, what a catastrophe. >> i want leslie to get one last answer. even if obamacare didn't cause a shortage of doctors and that could have been a gathering storm as you point out. what about what dr. carsonsaid it expands the bureaucracy and that's not what doctors ever wanted. >> directors never wanted that, but before the president was president, for crying out loud. ten, 20 years ago this started happening even before that. we have less people entering the medical school profession. they can't afford to pay back when they come out as a general practitioner, family medicine internist working hmo 70, $80,000 grand a year to pay back 500,000 in school costs and entering the profession. then you have to look at restraints. the reason my husband has to run so many tests chris is not because he has so many patients which he does, it's because he has to cover his butt so he doesn't get sued. >> right. >> that's how it is, that's what we've done in america. >> that's right. >> and the responsibility to the patients, we've flooded emergency rooms and the government said, whoa, and america, we have a problem. we didn't look into prevention, and that's what the affordable care act is trying to turn the clock back to do so that we can go back to our doctor.>> alisyn: of course and we know the affordable care act and congress did not go anywhere near tort reform. >> tort reform. >> right. didn't go far enough. >> alisyn: what doctors are calling for. leslie marshal, thanks for your expertise exactly the right person to book on this and chris, thanks so much for the debate. as we get new information that suggested the biggest manhunt in california's history could get even bigger we're' going to look at the claim that triple murder suspect christopher dorner may have had some help in hits apparent escape possibly into mexico and an american hero who rid the world of usama bin laden says the country he risked his life to defend says he's been left to himself. he'll have no health care, no pension, no benefits when he goes to retire ahead of time. a concerned veterans group is going to join us to talk about what the options really are that this hero to have. >> tonight i can report to the american people and to the world, the united states hasconducted an operation that killed usama bin laden the leader of al-qaeda and the terrorist responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children.>> esquire magazine went to print yesterday with the first interview with the navy seal that shot and killed usama bin laden. and he told about the raid, but the eye opening came when he detailed how he wants to he retire early and he's facing a future with no health care and no pension. and that's why the esquire cover says the man who killed usama bin laden is well, screwed. here is phil on hannity last night. >> if you quit before 20, you get zero. unlike private enterpriseyears for-- for years served. there's actually insurance available through the va, only for him and not for his family. five years of free insurance, president bush signed that into law in 2008. and he didn't know about it and didn't get it. part of the problem is there are some services out there, but the dod is not very good at communicating that to the vets. >> alisyn: joining us now to talk about all of this, the ceo of concerned veterans for america, hi, pete. >> hi, how are you doing? thanks for having me. >> alisyn: what an expose' on so many levels, this guy, phil bronstein says he checked and rechecked many sources and this is the shooter of usama bin laden. how can this hero go without a pension, go without benefits, go without health care? how is that possible? >> well, his story is very powerfulfully exemplifies many dysfunctions and difficulties our warriors are facing whenthey come off the battlefield. in the transition process sometimes happens in a matter of days with little information as he powerfully demonstrated and also in the va system which while it may be caring for him isn't always able it to care for his loved ones and also, it's just a bloated bureaucracy that doesn't meet the needs for 21st veterans. it's a pencil and paper bureaucracy growing in scope that has to be dragged into the digital aid to meet the unseen injuries that required mental health specialists. we don't have enough of them and the va isn't meeting these needs. >> alisyn: speaking of these injuries, let me layout the laundry list that he details of what he has acquired in the past 16 years that he had been doing these heroic navy seal raids. this is from the article. i'll read it to you. but the shooter will discover soon enough that when he leaves after 16 years in the navy, his body, filled with scar tissue, arthritis, tendinitis, eye damage andblown discs, here is what he gets from his employer and a grateful nation, nothing. no pension, no health care, no protection for himself or his family. and there is some criticism of this because he does get health care, as you just said through the va system, but it turns out, he didn't know how to accent this and nobody ever told him. that's a flaw in the system. >> that is a flaw in the system. and it's hard to believe, actually, of a navy seal of 16 years wouldn't know that, but you know, it's so complicated and disparity, and these guys are the best of the best of the best and think of the professional athletes at the top of their game. training staff waiting on them, they're getting all their needs met and when they're done with their career they're out there, like you and me at anytime fitness waiting at their doctor's office in the regular world. and what's the big difference? that athlete was paid millions of dollars to do what they do. this navy seal made maybe 60 grand a year, plus some combat pay now he can't talk about what he did because it's allclassified and walking into a civilian world can't talk about it, he's not a rich man, without an immediate ways to cash in on it unless he wants to carry a weapon as a contractor. he's in a really, really tough spot and i don't think the nation came to grip with the media with names and identity can be exposed. how can we care for these guys so it's on a track for these warriors, and this guy who put bullet in the head of usama bin laden. >> alisyn: and for his family, you're right he did make $60,000 a year, not a lot of money to sock away and even if he could go to the v pachlt heal-- va. or-- >> should go to uva. >> alisyn: and the health system can't cover your family. if you can't cover your sick child you may go bankrupt when they have illness. >> you may feel like you don't have insurance. there is a tri care transitional program familymembers are supposed to be enrolled in. if he didn't know about the va side, what does he know about transitional tri care benefits for the family? it's a disgrace and we must do better and the va must answer for it. >> alisyn: very quickly, how do we do better. >> you've got to digitize this stuff and create incentive i've gone through the va program with a g.i. bill, you were a number as opposed to an individual whose needs need to be met and a bureaucracy responsive to the need. and it's what bureaucracy created and needed to be dragged into the 21st century and tough questions asked. >> alisyn: always nice to talk to you. >> thank you. >> alisyn: new details from the catholic church what led to the stunning retirement of pope benedict. we're live from the vatican, what is going to happen with the first pope to step down from 600 years. if skydiving makes you squeamish, and wait until youhear about this man's experience, his chute malfunctioned and he fell 13,000 feet while unconscious, we've got the amazing story. yes, he survived.>> we have some terrifying new video to show you that captures the heart stopping moment when a california sky diver realized there was a problem with his parachute. there was a problem high above the earth, and caused the man to black out 13,000 feet above. and trace gallagher, i'm nervously thinking about it. >> reporter: he had been skydiving for two years and this was his 30th freefall and document today document the thing with a go-pro video camera, right, and jumpings out of the plane andexhilarated you can see that he's very excited when he begins this freefall. and he's at 13,000 feet, right?

lashing out at the president today. saying he did not think that the command ner-in-chief has the guts to address the nation's debt and deficit. and based on the tone of the inaugural address he expects tonight's speech to be very partisan. chief white house correspondent ed henry is live at the white house for us. ed, are we expecting it it to be very partisan. >> there's no doubt that the federal has signaled that he'sgoing to have a more aggressive approach in the speech tonight that he feels liberated after being reelected and frankly one of the last opportunities he has to have such a grand stage, such a big megaphone to sort of grab the attention of millions of americans about what his agenda in the second term is. by the time the next state of the union comes around he's going to start being a lame duck. there's no doubt about it. he wants to move on his priorities. so, he spoke briefly with reporters a short time ago and asked how the speech is coming along. he said we'll find out tonight and then his aides have been out there this morning, including gene spurling one of his top economic advisors and saying, we'll hear a lot from the president tonight is investment and republicans say that's more about spending government money and they say inside the white house, it's about stimulating the economy. take a listen. >> a stronger middle class, better educated, you know, working in manufacturing, innovation, entrepreneurship, small business, these are thethings that drive further economic growth. we've made a lot of progress since the deep recession of 2009, but this president's going to make very clear we have a lot further to go on job creation, on bringing down the deficit and investing in our people. >> now, you hear that brief mention of the deficit there so they say inside the white house the president does want to bring spending down, but when he mentions the word investment, republicans like speaker boehner, as you noted think it's more about government. he said i don't think he has the guts to do it. he doesn't have the courage to take on the liberal side of his own party, never has. so interesting on a night when we might see both sides come together at least a little bit and talk about what they may get done in this new congress that's meeting now. instead, you have a president who is planning to give perhaps a more partisan speech and a republican speaker laying down the gauntlet before this speech and saying he doesn't think the president has the guts to cut spending and really tackle the deficit. >> alisyn: that does not soundlike a harbinger of coming together of both sides. >> they'll be up there tonight together. so that could make for an interesting little moment. >> alisyn: all right, we will be on the lookout for all of those moments, ed henry, thanks so much. >> good to see you. >> alisyn: one issue threatening to overshadow the president's state of the union remarks is gun control. inviting a whole range of gun control advocates to capitol hill tonight leading one republican to respond by inviting musician ted nugent, a fierce second amendment defender, this as vice-president joe biden reached out to what he called the legitimate media, trying to recruit them for helping to get new gun laws passed. >> we're counting on all of you, the legitimate news media, to cover these discussions because the truth is that times have changed. >> alisyn: chris stirewalt is a fox news digital politics editor and host of power play on foxnews.com live. hi, chris.let's talk about the possibly awkward juxtaposition tonight there in the audience with gun rights advocates and gun control advocates all listening to the president. >> you know, when you get down to it, these state of the union speeches in the modern era are dog and pony shows and they're tout there and somebody's going to bring their dogs and other people going to bring their ponies and they're going to put them out there and they're going to do this. that's always been the case whether it's ted nugent or whom ever it is. though i don't think we'll get to hear cat scratch fever, but that's too bad. the truth is, and we know this, the vice-president, you heard the vice-president there talking about the fact that he wants the legitimate media, however he defines that to carry forward the issue of gun control. when the president talks about gun control tonight, the press, the establishment press that joe biden is talking about there doesn't need encouragement to pick up this story and run with it. neither do the liberals in the president's party. the president is going to talkabout a lot of things, he he'll go through a laundry list of policy we know that to be true. but unvariably the issue of gun control, so polarizing, so divisive. liberal base of the party, by the way the same folks that vice-president biden would need to cater to if he were to mount a presidency run in 2016, so incendiary, whatever else he's talking about, it's likely that this issue will predominant the day after and become the take away. and it sounds like it could be particularly incendiary. ted nugent appears gun rights advocate, he has said some very inflammatory things in the past and he's going to be sitting there somewhere near these-- all of these victims of gun violence, in fact, 22 house members have invited people who have been affected by gun violence. i mean, it sounds like a poignant back drop, but also one where there could bepalpable tension. >> oh, ali, i fully expect mr. nugent to be a perfect gentleman out there and this is not his first rodeo and expect that the folks that are very, very hard core gun control activists, gun banners, want a complete ban on guns and firearms in the united states who will be there and expect they will be well behaved and people generally rise to the occasion in this moment, but when you think of the raw numbers and the story lines out there. we know this, it will be impossible for those reporters the vice-president was calling out to yesterday to resist telling and telling the story that they relate to newtown, gun control and these issues and certainly mr. nugent. >> alisyn: i like your optimism. >> hey. everybody's going to be fine. >> alisyn: you have high expectations and i think that that is -- it's very, very nice. all right, chris stirewalt. thanks so much for the preview, it should beinteresting. >> you bet. >> alisyn: all right. mer, tune in tonight for special coverage of the state of the union. bret baier is going to kick things off at 8:55 p.m. eastern here on the fox news channel. we have new information on the biggest manhunt the search for the expolice officer could be south of the border and police believe that christopher dorner may have had help along the way to escape into mexico. william la jeunesse live from los angeles, what do we know about anyone who might have been helping dorner? >> according to federal court records a friend with the jy may have provided safe haven to christopher dorner as well as possible assistance in escaping police and jy is identified in his manifesto,as j young. and he had a cabin in big bear. and sitting fire to the truck and possibly because of a broken ankle or identified by police, dorner had to get off that mountain. several hours later the u.s. marshal saw jy in his vehicle down in orange county about 60 miles away from big bear and he could have provided the assistance that dorner needed to get off the mountain and to escape. now, police are not commenting specifically on that, but they're not eliminating any scenari scenarios. >> it is frustrating and we're hopeful that something will break loose from the the public and that these investigative leads will result in something very positive in terms of bringing this to a conclusion. >> right now there are three possibilities.he could still be in san bernardino or somewhere dead, and they continue the search. he could be in l.a. still a talking victims and going to mexico and raided a hotel last night in tijuana, no sign there. and obviously that's so serve racking for the general public. what are police telling them to do? >> well, it's like who wants to be a millionaire in l.a. so we've got the 1 million dollar reward now posted over the weekend. the number of tips coming in to the task force, 250 to more than a thousand they're looking at right now. where about, may be possible sightings of this guy dorner and that reward is likely to go up another 300,000 thanks to the l.a. city council and riverside board of supervisors and finally just to underscore where we're at in this investigation, police just today asked residents up in big bear after six days of a manhunt to provide any surveillance video that they may have from their homes that may show dorner or what kindof vehicle he may be travelling in. the bottom line, ali, police here are not sharing almost anything with us in the news media despite two conferences every day, little details about that investigation, back to you. >> let's hope they're closer than they're letting us know. william la jeunesse, thanks for the update. we'll have much more on the massive manhunt for christopher dorner and why word he may have escaped into mexico complicates bringing him to justice. we'll get take on this later in the hour. >> and we're getting reports that starting tomorrow, the president is expected to add to it a growing list of executive orders. on everything from immigration to gun control, to same sex marriage, but judge andrew napolitano says there are serious problems getting la larger here, he'll join us live after the break. and people are living in filth as their

>> well, first off an executive order is a piece of paper signed by the president directing someone who works for him. that's three million civilian employees, and two and a half million military employees to do their job the way he wants them to do.the president can't tell fox how to broadcast, the new york times how to print, chase manhattan bank how to manage money. he can only direct the executive branch employees as to how to do their job. sounds like it's pretty confining. >> it does. >>, but statutes have given him a lot of discretion, so, for example, he could say to the environmental protection administration, an independent regulatory authority independent of him. he appointed his people there, i would be very interested in seeing you tighten the regulation on coal fired plants. make it more expensive for them to produce heat by coal there by putting them out of business and going in a direction he wants them to go to. he could say to the veterans administration, which works for him, to the military, which works for him. i want you to change the laws on-- or i want you to change the regulations on spousal benefits of same sex married couples, even though under current federal law, there are no such benefits. he could say to the secretaryof the treasury, i want you to tighten regulations on the banks. he could say to the justice department, the large class of immigrants, i don't want you to prosecute them. all of those things would be lawful for the president to do because of power given to previous presidents that is now his to exercise, even though congress has decided knots to wade in there. >> alisyn: you know what the president, i assume, would say that congress is mired in gridlock so he's just not going to wait for them to take action and the american people want some action taken on some of these things. so, he's going to circumvent them. does he have an argument? >> well, he has an argument in the areas that he can regulate. you just had a great interview with our friend and colleague chris stirewalt. the president would like to sign an executive order confiscating guns, he can't do that. he'd like to sign an executive order banning certain type of guns, he can't do that. but he could have the epa decide, you know what? guns use bullets, bullets aremade of lead, when lead gets in the earth it contaminates the earth and someone's got to clean up that contamination, so let's charge the bullet manufacturers for the cost of cleaning up the bullets when they hit the earth. and that would increase the price of bullets, which would effectively the attacks. and would congress have enacted the tax? >> no, who is going to enact the tax. >> epa. says only congress can enact the tax. that's an area the president will try to get away with something under the constitution only congress can do. look for that tonight, alisyn and i think the democrats will applaud when he says that, and i don't think they have enough to do this. >> alisyn: and talking about laying out executive orders or epa regulations. >> i think's going to layout exactly what he wants to accomplish because if his inauguration address he could have gone like this to the american people let me bring you together instead like that, divide you by class, if that's any indication of whatwe can expect tonight. look for a strident, big government, hard left path to be laid out by him and one of the actors of that is gun control. the government thinks they can keep us safer than we can keep us safe. >> alisyn: judge napolitano. >> these are exciting times. >> alisyn: help us understand them. >> a pleasure. >> alisyn: what was supposed to be a fun vacation for 4,000 people has turned into a nightmare. a cruiseship at sea is without power and we're told conditions are getting worse and disgusting by the hour. and the vatican a day after pope benedict stunned the world announcing he'll resign at the end of the month. we have a live report from shepard smith. >> i'm sure that they'll find somebody that could, you know, further the catholic faith in a way that's strong. my bad.tell me you have good insurance. yup, i've got...

>> i think there was a bit of shock initially and now a great deal of curiosity about what will happen. there were some questioning, well, will the former pope help pick the new pope? no. the vatican says he will be out of the way and not be involved even in the politics of it it all. that's what they say. and what do you call the former pope when he's a former pope. since 1415 haven't had to dealwith that sort of thing and it's possible he'll be cardinal ratzinger again. and we know he'll live in the monastery in the back of the vatican city which you see over my shoulder and he'll write and pray, and the sorts of things that all cardinals do. there are a lot of questions whether there's something he has to say about the current pope then cardinal ratzinger, i surprise and differs with the new pope, is there a division in the church? all of these things percolating and these folks and catholics wonder why, what happens when there's a pope and a former pope. >> alisyn: shepard, you know italians, some of your closest friends, i can say this because i'm italian-american. we love the theatrical. we love drama. we love opera, we love palace intrigue. is there a lot of discussion about conspiracy theories ofperhaps not believing that this is just about his health? >> of course. and absolutely. and, but they had worked very hard to get in front of those things and even come out and said, look, he had a pacemaker, something probably people would have learned at some point. and he's had a pacemaker since before he was a pope and a couple of months ago, he had the batteries changed in the pacemaker under a veil of secrecy only his closest aides knew it. he went to a hospital here in rome somewhere, had the batteries redone, and never even missed one appearance. even the press corps, which follows the pope as closely i'd say the white house press corps follows the president, had no idea of all of this. so they're lifting the veil on some things that might have pushed along conspiracy theories, and you'll figure in the end they'll come up with new ones. the vet can says the pope is just running out of gas. i'm tired, i'm old, i don't feel i can give all that i could give at one point. he says his body has sloweddown and now given indications that his mind has slowed down at some point and leading us to believe, alisyn, that a year ago when the pope visited both mexico and cuba he felt himself completely out of gas and exhausted and decided he was going to give up the pace and even told his own brother about it at the time and kept the secret from all of us and a couple of days ago, he made the announcement. i'm sure he would send shock waves throughout the catholic world, nonetheless here we are at a moment of history, not since 1450. even o'reilly wasn't alive then. >> alisyn: hard to believe. shepard, what happens next? >> well, next on the 28th, of this month, 28th of february, the resignation becomes official and then there's no pope and sometime in the 15 to 20 days after this they have a conclave. they bring all the cardinals in, i think there are 106, 117 of them and only the ones under the age of 80 can participate in the conclave and they'll vote on the littlesheet of paper and probably take a few goes as a few years ago and white smoke will rise and the cardinal will come to the balcony and say we have a pope and there will be great celebrations, as italians and catholics and i guess, really, everybody here on this fat tuesday loves to have and the church will go on as it has for centuries before and i'm sure for centuries to come. there's a great deal of excitement here. a huge economic boom in a country that can very much use it now and there will be no mourning, which i think is new and in some ways exciting. you can celebrate this pope's life, his accomplishments and talk about the few areas some people felt he might have fallen short, while he's still alive without having to mourn and without having to bury. so i think it will be an exciting time in rome and throughout the catholic church. >> alisyn: shepard, we'll be watching you a half hour from now when you report on rome from studio b.thanks so much. all right. as the president puts the finishing touches on the state of union address, there are questions whether reelection has actually changed his personality. we'll tell you what some aides told one media outlet that is raising eyebrows today. and new reports suggest that the biggest manhunt is headed south of the border. how he may have escaped to mexico and why the manhunt could get messier if suspicions are true. one of the makers of bourbon says water down its kick.♪ >> well, as the president gets set to deliver his fourth state of of the union address, there are now questions whether reelection has actually changed his personality? some unnamed aide telling new york times the president has quote, shown an assertiveness, self-possession and even cockiness that contrasts with the caution, compromise and reserve he showed for much of his first term, leaving the author to question whether the president will overreach and alienate some americans and cement the partisan divide that he once promised to bridge and the readers to ask who gave this story to the times and why? let's debate that. joe trippi is a form campaignmanager for howard dean and erick erickson author of ""red state.com."" gentlemen, thanks for being here. >> and good to be with you, alisyn. >> alisyn: eric, let me start with you, there are a lot of descriptions in the article in the new york times, some of them good, some less flattery, assertiveness good, self-possession. cockiness not so good. why would somebody in the the inner circle talk about the new personality traits they see? >> well, you know, i think it's interesting they're characterizing them as new. i don't know that they necessarily are new. this is a guy on the campaign trail in 2008 in an interview said he was better policy person than policy people and better political strategist than his political people. i think they're now a little more free to talk about it and a worry among some of the democrats that i've talked to and afraid there could be overreach. second terms typically don't go well for presidents and some of them want to raise warning signals to try to rein back in the president.>> alisyn: joe, what do you hear? >> well, i think eric is right. i don't think there's much change. the president has been fairly confident and put his proposals and his gaerns out there and pushed through his health care plan despite a lot of opposition to it and i think he's got a very aggressive agenda for the second term and i think they believe, i mean, my understanding from talking to folks, is that they believe with their new organizing for action, ofa, taking the campaign apparatus and actually extending it into the presidency and getting the grass roots active and passing this agenda, that they can extend the period before he becomes a lame duck. they actually believe they can give-- you know, can get more action done, more of the agenda done prior to the 2014 mid terms and even think that they might be able to win those mid terms in a way that gives him more power in the last two years.very, very ambitious and, well, audacious, words the president used in the past plan. >> if you don't think that those character race particular, assertiveness, self-possession, cockiness are new. some used to describe him as a law professor, deliberative, and let me read you another part of the article that sounds like people think there's been a personality shift. he says that, the article says here, he even carries himself a little bit differently. he is relaxed, more volumable more confident than unusual, freer to drop profanities, and dismiss other's ideas. and supporters fear hubris. again, these are people in his circle, are they sending him a message? >> yeah, i think to some degree they probably are. remember, this is a guy who is never going to have to go before the voters again forhimself and showed the pro pensty in 2010 and 2012 where he really didn't campaign for a lot of other democrats, he made it about himself. there's no guarantee that the coalition that got him elected in 2008 and 12 will come out in 2016 and didn't in 2010. so, he kind of has the weights off his shoulders and some things he doesn't have to care about and the voters reelected me by a significant margin and thinks he has a mandate to go. >> alisyn: of course his critics thought that the president had a propensity for hubris, where people didn't think he was suffering from any inferiority complex, but again, these are people in the white house now now describing him that way. is that a change? >> again, i don't think so. i think eric's right. i think, look, he's free now. he doesn't have to stand for reelection again. he knows what he wants to try to accomplish in his last term.and he feels he's got the wind at his back with a lot of support from the majority of americans on a lot of the key issues that he wants to fight on. whether it's immigration, gun control, these are big-- they may be divisive, but he believes he's got over half the country with him on these things and again, he's facing a fractured republican party that's going to have two or three different responses to his speech tonight. so, i think if there's a real feeling, and by the way, i do believe there is a problem with overreach, that that-- all of those things can lead to overreach. a fractured opposition party and you feel you can ram right through it and get your agenda done. that can -- could possibly end up with overreach and turn the tide against him, but right now, i think he's going to try to push it and push his agenda through. and i don't see at least to date the republicans able to respond to that tonight.>> well, joe, it seems like that's true, what you're saying and in fact, eric, we know he's going to be announcing new executive orders, starting even this week. so, perhaps someone in the white house is kind of telegraphing overreach because they're seeing evidence of that? >> yeah, i think probably so. if you look at the gallup polling today. americans tend to disagree with the president on his overall gun approach, his overall approach to the economy and his overall national security approach. i think he's got to be careful. was he reelected by the american people because they endorsed his agenda which was shallow during 2012 or because they rejected mitt romney. if it's because they rejected mitt romney as we think. the public wasn't giving him a mandate for his agenda which he never campaigned on, they were just rejecting mitt romney. >> so, doesn't joe, the state of the union address should we be looking not just for the substance, but perhaps the difference in style of the president? >> when i expect the speech isgoing to be aggressive. i look more to what is the order of things he talks about. and what'serarchy of the speech what he's going to press on and where he's going to come from, but i don't think you're going to see a lot of compromise. i think he feels he tried that, it doesn't work in the first term, he's got support of the american people and he's going to push for the things he wants to push for and he doesn't have a price to pay anyway because he doesn't stand for reelection ever again. he'll never have to stand before the voters again. >> alisyn: we'll see what happens tonight. joe trippi and erick erickson, thanks so much. >> thanks. >> alisyn: the defense company that brought us the patriot missiles apparently working on a brand new software that's sending chills down the signs of some privacy advocates and the new technology can gather tons of data from social media sites which it was used to predict people's futurebehavior. trace gallagher is live in the west coast news room. tell us about that. >> it's actually a joint project with the defense contractor and a national security system to take the trillions of entries of cyber data and trying to analyze them, right? they named this thing formally the rapid information overlay technology or riot for short. what it does, it takes all of your facebook stuff. your cell phone stuff and twitter stuff and analyzes it and mixes it up and comes up with not just where you've been, who you've contacted or what you've done, but also what you're likely to do in the future. for example, they followed a raytheon employee and every time he posted pa pictures in one of the various cities, they used the stamp location of the photo and they matched it with google maps and pinpointed exactly where he was and what he looked like,finally, they checked all the places he's checked his phone or his facebook, his twitter account, and they came up with a likely pattern of future behavior and in this employee's case his likely pattern was, for example, the gym. listen. >> monday is the highest day followed closely by wednesday, and then here is the most interesting, if you look in check-ins by hour, 6 a.m. appears to be obviously the most frequently visited time at the gym. so if you ever wanted to get a hold of nick or his laptop you might want to visit the gym at 6 a.m. on monday. >> reporter: kind of crazy, they can take your entries and get them down to the millisecond where you made them and where you'll go next. and civil liberties groups are outraged and cell phone companies and internet providers they say they're not being consulted in all of this, but new technology really kind of pinpointing where you might be at a precise time in the future,alley. >> alisyn: wow, i wish the software could tell me what i plan to do next. that would be really, really helpful. thanks, trace. >> reporter: sure. >> alisyn: the massive manhunt is getting even bigger for the ex-cop and triple murder suspect, and of why he may have gone to mexico and could bring problems bringing him to justice. a former fbi will weigh in next. anyone have occasional constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating?

>> well, you've got to track down each one of the leads. what we're not seeing behind the fabric is what the investigators have been able to find checking his personal contacts and people he knows and places he frequented and what they would expect this pattern of behavior to be. we're seeing it from the outside and it's complex and i do believe he's kind of thrown a few lines out there to distract the authorities, but they're behind the scene trying it figure out how to predict where he may be. >> how could he have crosseded the border without a wallet. >> a couple of ways, and the same way could have come into the country. could have come not at one of the check points. and sometimes going into mexico is not as rigorous asout of mexico and we don't know the authorities were notified perhaps of his presence or anticipation of crossing the border. we don't know how much on alert they were. at this point i think it seems to be more kind of suspect than confirmed that he's in mexico. and keep the focus off where the search may be. >> alisyn: and they can't take the focus off anywhere, if he is in mexico, how much harder does that make the search? >> it makes it more difficult because you're relying on law enforcement agencies in mexico to assist on this as opposed to in the u.s. you have more control, you have the fbi, and helping to integrate some interstate leads and those types of things. in mexico even though they have good cooperation, you don't have direct control of it. >> we have a report earlier that one of his friends may have helped him somehow. do you think, given how long he's been out and how many people have been looking for him. he has had help? >> very interesting, the longer he goes now, the longer he had more extensive plans in place, where he had food, he had money, he had other means to keep himself alive, or he had help from other people,either in that preparation or even after he started to go on the run. the longer he's out there. the longer it suggests his plans are a lot more deeper and a lot more specific than we may have thought before. >> you know, he wrote in his manifesto, that he wanted to wreak havoc with the lapd and their families and wanted everybody to have the sense that no one is safe anywhere, your children aren't safe. he's going to perpetrate asymmetrical warfare and can't help, but think that he's deriving some perverse pleasure by the manpower to finding him. i know it's ridiculous perhaps, but any way they could just ignore him and let him flush himself out somehow? >> well, you can't ignore the fact that he's put people's names on a list and that's what they were doing to protect some of the individuals when he started in the last rampage of shooting people. in a way you're saying ignore him, but on the other hand he's proven himself to be a killer, proven himself to listpeople and go after people and need to provide protection and that's one of the things that kind of driving, certainly the fact that he's killed people, is driving the investigation. but not knowing, the now cost, increased cost not just of mobilization of people to look for him, but protecting all of those people on the list. it becomes a monumental efforts and even some ways, you know, he may derive that kind of satisfaction for the moment, but let's not kid ourselves. we don't know what his limit of rationality is, needs to be wrapped up in a law and order, csi kind of week long series of events. it doesn't have to be that way. it's at his timeline, when he feels as though he wants to perpetrate the next act and it could be as we've seen in other cases in the past, months if not years that this thing carries itself out. >> alisyn: we looked at how long it took to find eric rudolph and the uni-bomber and regular fugitives, but so many people are looking for him let's hope it ends soon. >> let's hope so. >> alisyn: the monks called it the water of life, depending on which brand you drink, yournext class of whiskey could be more watery than before. why you may want to make it a double on the next trip to the watering hole as a popular brand of bourbon announces it will soon be watered down. ♪ it's not with us.

""newsweek"" marks the most powerful woman in american history. the article reads like a piece of campaign literature than a serious examination of her record and her accomplishments. certainly, look, mrs. clinton is highly intelligent, she a global celebrate and she reached a level that few men,let alone women ever reach in our country. yet titles don't tell the entire story. the benghazi attack. a failed reset with russia. a more powerful and emboldened china. an iran closer to a nuclear weapon, slark terrorists fans out across north america? simply put, under barack obama and hillary clinton, the u.s. has been unwilling to lead. and this has left a huge vacuum on the world stage. in a recent assessment of secretary clinton's tenure. michael owe o'hanlon of the brookings institute wrote even an admirers such as myself must admit few big problems were soflted on her watch. few big vic trises achieved. secretary clinton's work at the state department should be judged on whether she has left america's foreign policy in stronger or weaker position. most think the future lies with china than the u.s. it's not all mrs. clinton'sfault. but the fact is we just don't have the influence we used to have around the world from syria to mali, we have led from behind, so in effect the former secretary of state has helped manage our decline in what looks increasingly like a post american world. and that's the memo. now on to the top story. another view on this, joining us now from new york, fox news contributor julie ragenski and former advisor to frank lautenberg and president rosenberg a center left think tank and campaign advisor to president clinton. all right, simon, tell me, where did i go wrong there on judging mrs. clinton? highly intelligent, global celebrity. >> yep. >> incredible run from first lady to senator to secretary. why was this a great tenure as secretary of state? >> first of all agrow agree with the negative characterization. i think we are safer today in the world than when barackobama took office. i think there have within two central legacies from her tenure. one that i think that she and president obama have put the democrats back on a course of more muscular foreign policy. i think that, you know, for 20 years foreign policy wasn't a major issue in the democratic party. whether it was globalization or opposition to the iraq war. we didn't real solid a forward leaning fiewrd policy. i think we have reestablished our commitment to free trade. democracy promotion. >> laura: how is it forward-leaning given what we didn't do in iran when we had -- looked like we had a real popular vote going there we really didn't do anything. in syria, there is debate what we should do there, nevertheless, clearly our policy there is a little bit confusing. >> clearly very forward leaning in the war on terror. clearly significantly involved in libya and egypt and trying to push things forward there. >> laura: even a lot of liberals were criticizing her. even people who like her. >> the second legacy for her is going to be about the asia. you raised.>> is america stronger or weaker than she was four years ago. >> i think america is stronger today. >> laura: on what measure? more people are looking to our country for leadership than they were four years ago. >> fewer people dying today than when they took office. >> laura: that's a different measure. >> you asked. much more respected in the world. this argument we are in decline is just false. i think we are going to be a different country than we were in the 20th century. our leadership is going to be different. we have to rely more on our alliances which is why a leader like hillary clinton who can work with people around the world is going to be a different model for secretary of state than we have -- >> bill: when you look back at someone like a kissinger or even a george kenan, george carter. you see a real secretary of state having a huge influence on the way foreign policy is carried out. and no one doubts that mrs. clinton worked really hard what did she accomplish upon humanitarian work andadvancing cause of women and girls around the world. >> i'm an admirers for hillary clinton for all the reasons you scritted fourself. at the end of the day george kenan had his policy which we all know about in the 40s, 50s. we certainly know henry kissinger who i don't necessarily agree with kissinger doctrine. still unclear what the doctrine. the thing with hillary clinton is people either lionize her or despise her. as opposed to look at her like a person who is very talented at the same time also flawed. we have to look very realistically. i think she has had some accomplishments. and some set backs. set back with russia was one that didn't quite work. benghazi obviously is benghazi. so, again, i will say this as a democrat despite all of that we need to look at her realistically. certainly not the saint people think she is and spinner other people think she is.>> laura: when you think about the attempt to repair our global image. more countries probably say they like us now. with russia a place i know something about. this idea we would give a reset button to russia. poorly translated. russia was going to help us in sir yand a other places around the world. guess what the russians saw that as a sign of weakness and on issue after issue the russians are blocking our way or actually acting in a way that hearkens back to the old soviet union not the are you sure shah that we might have thought. on that one issue, russia is a huge issue doesn't get enough attention but disaster. our relationship with them is worse than it was four years ago. >> part of what we are learning is that there are limits it to our power. what funny is i feel like i'm quoting george bush in the 2000 campaign where he said we have to be more humble in our foreign policy. i don't think america is in decline. our leadership is going to bedifferent. i think that the bush strategy of interconvention around the world was an utter failure. we actually have the worse foreign policy president in american history preceding barack obama. we -- i think hillary clinton and barack obama have put america on a much -- have v. reclaimed the tradition. >> laura: disseminated. >> they have been severely weakened, laura, come on. >> great to see both of you. >> thank you. >> up next on the rundown, new evidence the economy is still stuck in a ditch. we're going to break it down for you. and then the president's new pick for secretary of defense implodz at his confirmation>> laura: in the impact segment tonight, nor bad news for the u.s. economy. the january jobs report came out today and the unemployment rate is back on the rise. climbing a tenth of a point to7.9%. and even though the economy added 157,000 new jobs. nearly 23 million americans are still out of work or stuck in part-time jobs. here now with reaction fox news contributor, gary b. smith and joining us from new york is david callahan a senior fellow at demos which is a progressive think tank. all right, gentlemen. let's start with you this on the surface the stock market is rocking up to 14,000. don't you wish put more money in the market this month. this labor participation rate is hovering at an all-time low last 30 years. tell us what's going on in these jobs? >> dichotomy by the market which is owned by the obama 1%. in this case 5%. and the average investor has missed most of that move. we have taken it out in the depths of 2008 and not gottenback. in fortunately for people in the stock market there is a lot more money in the stock market that could go in. what you and i care about is exactly what you were talking about unemployment number. labor participation rate. for all the emphasis stimulus and whatnot that the administration has put in place they haven't bunged the needle at all. participation rate is now less than it was when obama took office. less than it was in january january 62009. unproiment rate including people that have stopped looking for jobs. it's actually higher than when he was inaugurated. >> tell us why this ends up being great economic news for the country because we have unemployment number going back up yet there was job growth. 160,000 or so per month but not really up at that 300,000 you really need 270, 280, 300,000 level to see a realrobust recovery. >> it's not great economic news. i'm glad gather mentioned that u 6 number because, in fact, these unemployment statistics way under estimate the number of people out of work there are a lot of people who are discouraged. this is, you know, the same story we have been seeing for the last couple of years. which is, you know, employers are not hiring. and a big reason for that is consumers don't have money. and why don't consumers have money? well, big reason is because they have not been seeing their incomes go up. why haven't they been seeing their incomes go up because a lot of the wealth being generated in the economy is going to that 1%. that's why the stock market is doing so well. corporate earnings are strong. corporate profits hit record levels at times in the last couple of years. but the money is just not trickling down to the average worker. a lot of jobs aren't going to come back because of they are being replaced by machines, new technology, by outsourcing. we have a structural problem in the economy here. david, who is to blame here?it's a complicated thing. i know it's not one person, probably. there is enormous amount of downward pressure at the same time, especially on those job creators and small business. and the ones that i interview in my radio show, these people aren't political people. laura, we are getting crushed here. >> yeah. not only our tax rate but getting crushed on these new obama care regulations. we have to put back people's hours. we love these people. these are community people. these are families, our friends. but we're barely making ends meet. we have to make a payroll. so the idea this is the big pollute craft, raping the poor people that narrative is really tired. >> it's not the big polutocrat it's the structure of modern capitalism. in the bush years when we did have strong employment growth a lot of jobs being created was low rate jobs. >> laura: globalization. >> also in the retail sector, the biggest area of job growth last month was retail jobs a lot of those retail jobs don't pay more than $20,000 a year.meanwhile the big retailers are making record profits. that is a structure problem in the economy. we need stronger labor unions. we need higher minimum wage. >> stronger labor unions. how do we compete with china, vietnam, south korea, india when we are going to have stronger labor unions that insure that we have more work place regulations. more ways that business has to pay more money to make ends meet? the two things don't add up. i understand what david is saying. >> david somehow wishes it was 1930 when we had the highest participation in unions instead it's 12% participation. the reason is that unions don't work. you know, david kind of, i understand the kind of the point is he measmght the employment is he implying it's the haves that have it all and taking away from have notes. >> four years of barack obama in the white house and still blaming the congress. this is lunancy. the president has been in charge for four years. >> exactly laura. the reason that it in david's world there is no jobs beingcreated amongst the have not is that there is such strong head winds for job creators. they look at higher taxes, they look at obama's constant bashing of the obama -- >> laura: downward pressure on companies hiring. david, that so much. coming up next, chuck hagel coming under fire at his confirmation hearing did. his performance destroy any chance he will be the next secretary of defense? and then, even joe biden is admitting that more gun control will not prevent another massacre like sandy hook. geraldo will react. we hope you stay around for those reports. this happy couple used capital one venture miles for their ""destination wedding."" double miles you can ""actually"" use. but with those single mile travel cards... [ bridesmaid ] blacked out... but i'm a bridesmaid. oh!

[ all screaming ] watch the elbows ladies.>> in the personal story segment tonight, the fallout is still being felt tonightfollowing chuck hagel's performance yesterday at his senate confirmation hearing to be the next secretary of defense. >> name one person in your opinion who is intimidated by the israeli lobby in the united states snad. >> well,. >> well, first -- >> name one. >> i don't know. >> why would you say it? >> i didn't. have in mind a specific person do you agree it's a provocative statement that i can't think of a more provocative thing to say about the relationship between the united states and israel and the senate or the congress than what you said. >> do you think the election that had to do with this iranian government coming to power was free and fair and legitimate? >> i noted that the term legitimate was not the term i should have used. i should have used recognized. that's the more appropriate term. >> were you correct or incorrect when you said thatthe surge would be the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam? were you correct or incorrect? >> my. >> yes or no? >> my reference to this- >> -- are you going to answer the question, senator hagel? the question is were you right or wrong? that's a pretty straightforward question. >> despite that, white house spokesman jay carney today says he thinks hagel will be confirmed. joining me now from cleveland is former congressman and current fox news contributor dennis kucinich. all right, congressman. you were unon capitol hill for a long time. you saw that hearing and how it took place and how chuck hagel carried himself, rate his appearance from his point of view. rate his appearance from a to f. where did he falling in the grade level? >> i think it's a b. i will tell you why. >> laura: b? you grade on a curve. [ laughter ] well, maybe. i wish i took classes from you. >> he will be appointedsecretary of defense. sea combat veteran. he would being the first enlisted man who became secretary of defense. two purple hearts. saved a man's life. took shrapnel to the chest. he could be an action hero. instead is he going to be secretary of defense. >> by that measure, john mccain should have been president in 2008 up against a guy who had no experience in executive branch and experience in the military. >> -- and no experience in the military. >> i have the highest regard for john mccain. is he a friend of mine. i actually went and visited where he was held in captivity with com sam johnson. he is an amazing man and i like him a lot. this is whether hagel is going to be secretary of defense. based on who he is and his service to the country. i never voted against israel in his 12 years in the senate. i think he is somebody who wants peace, he he is strong. he will keep us out of wars. i think that we need somebody in that position. >> here is what bill kristol wroited today, chuck hagelisn't a first rate candidate for secretary of defense. he isn't even a second rate candidate. has there ever been a more embarrassing confirmation hearing than hagel for a measure cabinet position. for a minor cabinet position or subcabinet position. we don't know of one. congressman, i understand the white house says he will probably get confirmed and, you know, i guess he will. i don't really have any inside information. they say they have a lot of yes votes. but that appearance, i don't care if you like him or got three purple hearts or no purple hearts, that appearance to me was shocking. the fact that he didn't know his -- the president of the united states policy on containment. he botched that he had to have people come and hand him notes during the process? the fact that he didn't -- couldn't answer john mccain's very simple question? he seemed confused. out of his depth. he didn't seem to know, i don't think, have a level of understanding or sophistication about american policy that one would expect.and that is aside from his position. >> laura, 12 years in the u.s. senate on foreign relations, he is a smart man. and he wouldn't be. >> laura: he just had a bad day. >> this isn't dantsing with the stars. he wants to be secretary of defense. the troops will love him based on the fact that he is actually serves some veterans who are committing suicide. imagine chuck hagel. can he relate to them and try to do something about it. we understand who understands the troops. >> he is he not being confirmed to be secretary of veterans affairs. i think that would actually be probably a position he would be very well suited to. but, this is a man who his statement that he voted for the war in iraq, then he said the surge would be the biggest foreign policy blunder our military, our country had ever seen. that obviously was not the case. all he had to say was that was a mistake. i shouldn't have said that i was i don't think. he couldn't really bring himself to say that clearly. >> not perfect. the best choice, courageousman the troops will love him. >> congressman, it's great to he see you and the president certainly is very confident of that confirmation. and plenty more ahead as the factor moves along this evening. jill biden joining the list of people who think more gun control will not mean fewer pass shootings. another american embassy attacked by terrorists. we have details. weep hope you stay tuned for all of those reports.

reporting democrats have been pushing new gun laws in the wake of the massacre in newtown, connecticut. now the leader of the pack vice president joe biden is telling reporters the new gun laws probably wouldn't preechted another new town. quote: nothing we're going to do is going to fundamentally alter or eliminate the possibility of another mass shooting. but there are things that we can do. that have virtually zero impact on our second amendment right to own a weapon for both self-defense and recreation that can save some lives, unquote. joining us now from new york, fox news host geraldo rivera. >> hi, laura. >> geraldo, it's great to see you. what about biden now? he is sounding like he could say something on my radio show. something i would have said. what's going on? >> first of all, i think the vice president is absolutely correct when you consider that these grotesque massacres perpetrating by crazy people,wielding assault style weapons with extended magazines are a tiny member sen damage of the victims of gun violence in the country. banning the assault weapon, banning the extended magazine, although i am in favor of doing whatever we can, are largely symbolic efforts. so he is absolutely right about that i think what he is alluding to, laura, is the push for universal background checks on all gun sales, including those private sales either transactions, totally privately, or at gun shows where they put up a sign that says private sale and, therefore, exempt themselves from federal gun background checks. i think everyone who sells or transfers a gun should have a federal background check done on the purchaser, i think a record should be made. any gun lost, stolen, i think that's a good idea that can be helpful. but i have got a way to do it. and this is the way to do it. what vice president joe biden should be pushing right now is to expand new york city's stopand frisk law to every police precinct in this country with a level of gun violence rises above a certain threshold level. we should have every cop, if they suspect reasonably that a person is carrying a weapon or doing something nefarious or criminal, the cop has the right to pat them down as they are here in new york which has been hugely successful. >> laura: i imagine groups like la ross so -- la larose isa will be against that -- most of the killings in places like chicago, for instance, they take place with handguns. not just the 9-millimeter with a 15 bullets in the magazine type deal, but 38 specials. niece aren't guns that will r. going to be banned. the idea of banning a 15. .6% killings committed with that type of assault weapon. that is silly.is it a concession by the white house that they know they are not going to get anything like that through. >> it might be a concession by the white house to what is possible. because they know they are not going to get the assault weapons through. but you mentioned chicago. compare chicago with new york, new york has stop and frisk. chicago has three and a half times more murder per capita than new york does. >> laura: gang violence. >> absolutely more gun violence. you see a gang banger, a bunch of them hanging out on the street, that cop, if it's in a precinct that has a certain level of gun violence, that cop has the right to go roust those kids what are you doing here? what you have got in your pocket that's how you eliminate by going to the criminal perpetrator. >> laura: we are almost out of time. h.h.s. contraception mandate, all these lawsuits about 40 or so filed against the administration. most on religious grounds.now, h.h.s. comes out with a slightly expanded exemption. tell us about it. i'm looking for the name of the company. the hobby. >> laura: hobby lobby. >> right. hobby lobby is a christian owner of this crafts chain who said that he is not going to provide abortion-related services or birth control related services because he personally as a christian opposes it. now, the new expanded exemptions to the federal mandate for having contraceptive coverage and coverage for morning after pills and so forth only applies really to nonprofits. so, hobby lobby. >> laura: they are out of luck. >> what i say is in this case, have the groups that are pro-choice, proabortion, create a pool, an insurance pool entirely private so that people like this conscientious christian, hobby lobby owner don't have to do somethingreprehensible to his moral code. let the private people provide that service so everybody has access but you don't force it down their throat. >> laura: this exemption is still quite narrow. >> it is. >> laura: against institutions that are nonprofit. geraldo, it sounds like you are putting together policy papers like a future senator. >> did you know -- i mean, you got stop and frisk. you have got the h.h.s. pool of new types of insurance. are you serious about this senate run? when are you going to make a decision. >> i'm seriously contemplating. my wife erica and i are talking about it we are exploring it. very excited as new jersey residents. we can revive, we think, the g.o.p. in the garden state. hopefully get the support of people like our incomparable governor chris christie and others. i have got my fingers crossed and i'm also probing it. it is something we areseriously considering. definitely. >> laura: geraldo packed. >> move to jersey. >> laura: okay. well, next on the run down another attack on american embassy today. this time a deadly suicide bombing in turkey how will the united states respond?

unresolved problem segment tonight, a suicide bomber struck the u.s. embassy in turkey today killing himself and a guard. turkish officials suspect the bomber was connected to a domestic left wing militant group but so far no terror outfit has claimed responsibility. at the white house today jay carney was quick to call it an act of terror it? >> it is a terrorist attack. however, we do not know at this point who is responsible or the motivations behind the attack. the attack itself is clearly an act of terror the bombing comes just a few months after chris stevens was killed in a terror attack on american consulate in benghazi. with us now fox news strategicanalyst lt. colonel ravel peters. first before we get into that. i know you wanted to respond to the hillary clinton segment we did at the top of the show. most powerful woman in u.s. history rating her term as secretary of state? certainly say that the most powerful woman in american history was eleanor roosevelt. like it or not. to paraphrase another political voice. hillary is no eleanor. she hasn't been a bad secretary of state, she has beened me okay kerr. around average, maybe slightly below average. >> ending with benghazi in the last day on the job, you know turkey attack, that's not saying it was her fault. >> i don't think she moved the ball forward. but also to be fair to hillary, she was doing obama's foreign policy, which was the reset with russia and we're going to deal with putin basically a re-set with iran. don't met with hugo chavez. so, i will cut her slack onthat. none the less, i think she was energetic, very hard working and dedicated. >> just not sure what her influence was in the end. let's move on to the turkey situation. in ankara, this bombing today, what does this tell us about where we are in the world. turkey an important ally in the united states. they have their own troubles. >> attacks on u.s. embassies and other u.s. installations or new companies that's the new normal. it's going to go beyond our life times i believe, the middle east is so utterly broken and trying to right itself now very long struggle, we will see more of this. the good news today was the terrorists lost. while they did get through the usually very tight turkish security in the democratic corridor. turkish security guard did his job, wouldn't let the attacker in attacker in frustrationblows himself up and kills that brave guard. hurts other people with flying debris. the bomb, beyond that didn't do much, as far as i'm concerned u.s. one, terrorists zero on this one. we see north africa from mali to niger and obviously see what happened in egypt just last as i wanted with all the rip pelsz from that. no one in custody. i don't know where this investigation is going but we really didn't seem to get oh my gosh you are not listening to our president. there is no such thing as islamic jihad. inner struggle. islamist doesn't exist. >> laura: misunderstood youth. violent extremism. >> better than humans cause or man made disasters whatever they were. back to turkey the turks areembarrassed, blaming this left wing organization. i bet iran was this. >> laura: great to see you. >> my pleasure. grecketly ahead. president obama and senator marco rubio both pushing immigration reform this week. will push back by their own will push back by their own partieieieieie twins. i didn't see them coming. i have obligations. cute obligations, but obligations. i need to rethink the core of my portfolio. what i really need is sleep. introducing the ishares

tonight, senator marco rubio and bipartisan group of colleagues unveiled exreb comprehensive immigration plan earlier this week. before that happened the senator stepped into the no spin zone recommendation we need legal immigration it's good for our country. it's right to have immigration laws and sovereign country to enforce those laws. we have a problem. our legal immigration system is antiquated and needs toremodernized. for farm workers, we can't just have 6.5% of the people that immigrate here be unskilled and talent. we need to up that number. that doesn't mean under my family based immigration but we have to have more skill-based immigration. the second thing we have to do is real enforcement that includes improving the infrastructure at the border and getting operational control of the border that includes work place enforce. whether that's everify or something that's works. that means by the way tracking people when they come in the country and when they leave as visitors because 40% of our illegal immigration are visa overstayers. >> bill: all of that with the technology we have should be doable. the real elephant in the room. >> sure. >> bill: are the 12 million illegal aliens what do you do. >> i don't like that either. i british why didn't have 8 or 12 million people here undocumented and we do. we have to deal with it we have to deal with it in a way that's compass that the but also responsible. here is how i would deal with it first of all commit a serious crime and you are deported. no one would disagree with that if you have come forward be fingerprinted and background check for nationalsecurity and crime. you have to pay back taxesment and pay fines. be here for significant period of time no english and be assimilated when you do all of those things what you do is get a work permit basically a legal status, not a green card to allow you to be in this country legally and to work. >> bill: get a driver's license, insurance things like that. >> legally here. basically nonpermanent visa. >> bill: be on social security. >> under that status no one qualifies for any federal benefits. >> bill: all you get is is the right to work, the right to have a driver's license. the right to staz here. >> that's the first part of it you have to be in that category for a significant period of time. when a significant period of time has elapsed, you haven't violated any of those conditions, and, in fact, the border has been secured, the work place enforcement mechanism is in place, all of that happens, that would trigger a second phase. that second face is this: all you would get at that point is the opportunity to apply for the existing legal immigration system. >> bill: but you could still be here to do that. >> while you are waiting. you have to get in line behind everyone that applied before you. you have to qualify for thevisa when your term comes up. all you get is access to the existing system. >> bill: what i'm seeing here is maybe a 7 to 10 year period where an illegal alien currently here does get an opportunity to make a living, can stay, and then can apply for citizenship but the process is going to take -- >> actually they don't apply. they apply for a green card. after you get your green card you have to wait another five years to apply for citizenship, which you have to pass the exam and do all the other stuff. >> bill: that seems to be pretty fair. how does that differ with what the president wants. >> i don't know what the president wants. he talked about pathway to citizenship. my problem with that is this and the way you structure it. you can't do that in a way that's unfair to the part-time that are doing it the right way. in essence, i can't go to someone who is trying to come here legally, is waiting in line, paid all. >> bill: these people are ahead of you. >> you should have come here legally it would have been easier. >> bill: i'm surprised though. you are taking the lead in the republican sense of putting this forth and you haven't discussed it with the president? hasn't he called you. >> no. they never talked with us about it the truth is, look, the way our public is designed the congress is supposed topass law and the president can decide whether to sign it or not. >> bill: you are a leader. shouldn't the president be conferring with leaders in the house and the senate? >> i would be more than happy to talk them and explain my principle to them. >> bill: he hasn't called. >> no. here is the bottom line. we will work with the colleagues to get something responsible done but fair but also responsible. we don't want to invite advise people who come here illegally in the future. >> bill: tough on this issue and border security. it's getting better. the stats show it's getting better. i think they have handle on it now. i like your program. i think it's fair. so, i want you and president obama to get on the phone and get this thing so it doesn't turn into a bloody mess. >> maybe we can come on the show together. >> absolutely. i will give you the whole hour. you guys will come on and we will sort it out. you know what? i don't know if president obama wants to solve thighs problems. i think he wants to destroy the republican party, particularly in the eyes of hispanic american voters, so he is going to make it as hard as possible to get anything done and demonize you guys. i hope i'm wrong, but that's what i'm seeing here. with the fiscal business and now with the guns and now with this. >> i hope you are wrong, too.because ultimately we have a chance to involve solve an important issue and do it the right way. >> bill: do you think i'm wrong. >> i don't think. >> come on. >> i can tell you that i believe that there are people in the democratic party or i should say on the left that would prefer to have immigration as an issue than as a solution. >> bill: does he want them. >> we will have to find out. i hope the answer is. no. >> bill: would you put in a call to him and see if you can talk to him. i'm sure we will be talking to them soon one way or the other. >> bill: would you let me know. >> you don't think he watches this show. >> bill: he is busy. i'm sure he gets a transcript of it. i would like your office and you to try to set up some meeting with him with some republican senator leaders and go over and talk about it and let me know what happens. >> all right. we will do that. >> bill: because that's the only way, transparency is the only way going to get this thing done. the fiscal thing, gun thing. transparency. if the president of the united states is not going to cooperate with the opposing party, we need to report that that's going to be very very very important going forward. because why all want fairness and i think your program is agood one. >> laura: up next, will the conservative outcry over senator marco rubio's plan kilt measure. that debate 60 seconds away. ♪ using robotics and mobile technology, verizon innovators have made it possible for teachers to teach, and for a kid...nathan. tadpole. ... to feel like a kid again. because the world's biggest challenges deserve even bigger solutions. powerful answers. verizon. here is what david vitter told knee week on my radio show. >> i love and respect marco. he is amazingly ney ev naive ot issue. >> joining us from san diego is enrique maronez and an immigration activist and head of the group border angels and steve from the center for immigration study. let me play devil's advocate here. marco came on with bill and came on with me this week andtalked about how the new plan does include a real aggressive approach to enforcement that was not in the 1986 amnesty that the commission will be he appointed, the border security will be certified and only then will these undocumented immigrants be able to apply for a path to citizenship. they will have provisional legal status but won't have the pathway to citizenship. what is your response to that? everybody gets amnesty on the first day. not only a social security number but everything that comes with it. u.s. esche sued identification. a driver's license. the ability to travel to and from the united states. open a bank account and get a home loan. everything comes on the first day with the green card light. if we don't enforce the law they can just stay in that status which is what most of them want anyway. if we don't ever enforce the law you we are not taking that away from them. the idea is if we do say thelaw is being enforced they can move to a regular green card and then eventual citizenship. the fact is everything gets amnesty on the first day. vitter has a real point. all of the amnesty up front with the promise of enforcement coming later and it means you to trust the administration to enforce the law and past experience with successive presidents suggests the law simply will not be enforced. >> enrique, let's go to you on this. the white house i believe and chuck schumer have aid the saiy are not going to let enforcement stand in the way of a path to citizenship but say we do believe enforcement has to be better enhanced and so forth. what is your take on what you heard so far from rubio? >> well, the thing is that enforcement has never been stronger. you know, when you have more people actually going south than coming north talking about the u.s. mexican border the devil is in the details. we want toughened ou to find oyare talking about with enforcement. we don't know the details yet. nobody is looking from amnesty. that comes from the greek word which means to forget which means like amnesia. comes from the same word. marco rubio wants to have tougher enforcement on the border. how tough is tough enough? it is important to know the details. we are encouraged that both sides of the aisle want to take on immigration reform finally but we had that situation before and it has fallen apart. give these people the chance for the first time to actually become documented because the overwhelming majority, two thirds of the 11 million undocumented people have no way to get in line. let them get in line and then after that -- >> i have a practical question for you. >> sure. >> let's say this is agreed and there is some plan agreed to and there is some enhanced enforcement that comes into play. what about someone who comes across the border let's say two weeks after the comprehensiveplan is agreed to, signed into law. do you think the new people coming across the border should also be grandfathered in so they should also have a path to citizenship. in any end to the legalization process? >> well, as you know, there has been about a 40% drop in people coming into the country. >> that is because of the bad economy. you know that and i know that. let's say people come in and when they do come in do they get to become part of the new world, path to citizenship, yes, or no? >> no, because there is a way for them to come in through the front door which isn't available right now. finally a way to come in through the front door. >> ellis island and angel island people went in and registered. in angel island people were quarantined. it was a different situation. >> very few were quarantined, just like today would be. >> what is your response to that? enrique says depends on the devil is in the details.what is the problem with enforcement in the people. obama said he is not going for piece meal. >> he wants the whole enchilada. six times congress has passed an entry exit system. we think 40% of illegal aliens are visa overstays. we still don't have it. each time congress has backed off the bureaucracy resisted. congress mandated abortedder fence for most of the border. it is still not completed. anybody who thinks there will be enforcement is dreaming. the amnesty comes first and that is it. >> just a quick programming note before we go. i will be on ""fox

  and nsa surveillance programs after the white house issues secret court rulings and president obama says he's on a personal mission to make colleges more affordable. we'll tell you what he's got planned.   welcome to the ""journal"" editorial report. growing concerns both here and abroad about america's hands-off approach to the middle east.egypt moves closer to civil war. a syndicated columnist and author of 11 books on the middle east joins me now from london. welcome back to the program. great to have you here. >> thank you. . >> good, let's look at syria. first, a year ago, i think it was, president obama famously said their use of chemical weapons would be a red line that syria shouldn't cross and would have consequences. what is bashar assad's consequences that he's willing to cross that line? >> what happened recently was the sixth attack and now a pattern is emerging, each attack has been bigger than the previous one. so he has been testing both the international and public opinion, the united states resolve and also how far he cango inside syria. now we can establish that pattern quite clearly. >> so he figures he's testing the u.s. and so he thinks he can move ahead as he wants to do, that's how you would see it? >> and also, you know, in every case, government media are supporters of the government to leaf the areas targeted before, sometimes they wait for several weeks and then they attack. in every case they attack places picked by the up discussiopposie rebels, to keep the rebels from creating a government. so it is clear that is part of an overall military strategy on his part. >> now the president isconsidering the use of force in the wake of these chemical attacks. do you think that would make a difference and should the united states enter militarily in response to these attacks? >> well, the first thing to do is to make the united states position politically clear. the united states has lost a lot of its credibility in the middle east recently, people hesitate to take it seriously as a major power, it has proved to be a fickle friend. the president says something and nothing happens and so on. so you have to restore confidence first before we can discuss the use of weapons. otherwise if you fire a few rockets as president clinton used to do in afghanistan and then sit back, that would be quite useless. >> but when you say establish -- re-establish political credibility, what do you mean?do you mean side with the rebels, for example and say look, we are going to act more assertively on their behalf? >> no to take a clear political position in saying that we cannot as the international community allow president assad to continue treating his people, it is clear that the attacks were done by him. there is ample evidence, the president knows this. and this attack is enough to assign a team of american experts to study the area, you would find that the attack has happened. >> right. >> but president obama is hiding behind russia's president putin, in fact the two of them are working together in a sense, putin threatens the veto and obama says because of the threat of veto, i can't do anything.>> so you would put together, if you were president obama, you would put together a coalition with the french and the turks and the saudis and others that would interceed in syria, that's what time trying to get at here, would you pick one side to intervene? >> if you want clear things to do, first of all, you know, to organize the refugee areas in iraq, in jordan, in lebanon, in turkey and so on to protect them against president assad's attacks, to create a no-fly zone in areas liberated by the rebels, especially in the kurdish areas of syria, so that they cannot use russian made air force to bomb them, and then to try to tip the balance of armament in favor of the rebels by giving them some weapons with which they can defendthemselves. and we are not talking of an invasion by american troops, you know, or any direct military participation by the u.s. but, you know, indicating that the u.s. is not on the side of president assad and is on the side of the rebels, and will not tolerate assad's regime. >> all right, that sounds like an intervention on the side of the rebels, if not u.s. troops on the ground. amir terry, thank you very much for being here. >> it is interventionlike for the time being. >> thanks.   when we come back, new outrage over the reach of the nsa's surveillance program here at home. but just how worried should we be? so then the little tiny chipmunks go all the way up... ♪ [ female announcer ] when your swapportunity comes, take it. ♪ what? what? what?[ female announcer ] yoplait. it is so good. do you mind grabbing my phone and opening the capital one purchase eraser?

>> none whatsoever, paul. i'm an anti-terror absolutist,okay? if i may analogize it, it's a law enforcement agency like the fbi or the police department. they have the capability, clear, to do awful things. the police carry guns and billy clubs, if they wanted to walk down the street pistol whipping people, they could do that, they have the ability. but they don't, why don't they do it? because there are laws and rules preventing them from doing it. there are laws preventing the nsa from doing awful things. there's never been a single identifiable example of a person whose e-mail was damaged or readily the nsa. >> you can abuse guns, but they don't, or if they do they are punished. they have the capacity, the nsa to listen to 90% of our online communications. >> this is about collecting information. we have a government that has repeatedly undermined our trustin washington. now they're saying, don't worry, we got this covered. it's very hard to put the american people in a position where they have to choose whether they're going to trust this government or if they don't, they are going to be accused of not helping on the war on terror. >> all right, mary, the 75% figure is a capacity figure, it's what they're capable of doing. we kind of knew they had something like that capacity. the nsa responded and said, look, we don't listen to that. we have access to really about 1.6% that we really look at of these communications and a much smaller fraction. and by the way, these are foreigners that we're listening in on. >> the point is, the government is not supposed to let high-powered weapons go into mexico. it's not supposed to have the irs targeting political enemies. it's not supposed to abandon men in the field in benghazi. there's lots of reasons why the rules, as we so confidently look at them and say, you know, thatthis protects us, might not be backed up. i mean, you know, there are -- >> would you stop doing those? >> i would not stop doing it, but i think ray kelly was right when he said, look, the obama administration could have been a lot more transparent about what's going on here. be straight with the american people, tell them that their e-mails may be captured in this sweep. i think that american people can handle that, what they can't handle is secrets held by the obama administration which they don't trust. >> ray kelly, the new york police commissioner. >> my heart is with jane amary heart is with dan. i distrust the nsa. if you go back and read a story in our newspaper in 2008, what we have learned is entirely consistent with that, if you describe the scope of the way this operation working normally.that and the snowden details have put more detail to it. in specific, the revelations about the court admonishing the nsa suggests there is a mechanism for dealing with error, at least, and potentially with abuse. >> and the administration released the court rulings, declassified them themselves, this is not a leak, so it got the information out there and it does show that there is a process by which mistakes overreaching is corrected. >> yeah, it was human operator error, it was not intentional evil grabbing e-mails and reading them. they worked with that judge, if you read down to the bottom of the statement and they corrected the problem to the satisfaction of the court and the court said problem solved. >> is your problem, james, that it's this president or is it the programs themselves? and i want to ask mary that too. >> i have a basic distrust of the government, i think ahealthy skepticism of our government is part of the american way, and yes, i'm particularly mistrustful of this administration for the reasons that mary gave. on the other hand, we have, as dan says, no evidence that the nsa has been corrupted in the way the irs was. >> mary, the specific abuses at the irs bother me a lot more than this. because you actually there have cases where the government did specifically attempt to punish individuals for their political beliefs, in this case, nsa. we don't have any examples of that. >> i think most americans would prefer that you don't giver the opportunity to anyone in government. james madison pointed out, this is not about individual human beings, this is about creating a system that you don't have to depend on this person or that person or, you know, being trustful, but that the system itself would control any kind of abuse against individuals. the other thing is that thisinformation can get into the hands of other people, it's not just the government. i think the edward snowden case is a perfect example of that. >> certainly you have more to fear from criminal hackers than you do from the nsa. you cannot have a big database like that finding terrorists and do the things that you're suggesting. >> be straight with the american people.   still ahead, college students head back to campus with a record number relying on federal financial aid to meet skyrocketing college costs. but president obama says he has a plan to make tuition more affordable. details are next. having some fiber! with new phillips' fiber good gummies. they're fruity delicious! just two gummies have 4 grams of fiber! to help support gularity! i want some... [ woman ] hop on over! [ marge ] fiber the fun way, from phillips'.♪ now you can give yourself a kick in the rear! v8 v-fusion plus energy. natural energy from green tea plus fruits and veggies. need a little kick? ooh! could've had a v8. in the juice aisle.at a time when a higher education has never been more important or more expensive, too many students are facing a choice that they should never have to make. either they say no to college and pay the price for not getting a degree, and that's a price that lasts a lifetime. or do you what it takes to go to college, but then you run the risk that you won't be able to pay it off because you've got so much debt. >> president obama at the state university of new york rolling out the plan to curb college costs. this comes as a new department of education report reveals that a record number of students are taking out loans and a record number defaulting on those loans. we're back with dan henninger, wall street assistant editor and elisa finley also joins thepanel. for five years i have been listening to the president say he's making college more affordable and now he's saying its unaffordable. >> he's got to pay more attention because he's done the big tour saying how he's making college easier to afford. now he's saying we can't afford the trillion dollars of student loans out there. he p >> so what's going on with the politics here? >> i think people are hoping that basic economics will, now that it's asserting itself will also be appreciated by the white house. you have, for years now, a situation where the government subsidizes college education and now is shocked that prices are rising, haven't done so much to pump them up with these grants and loans. i hope there's a market solutionas opposed to beating up colleges. >> the administration said that since 1983, fees tuition and four year college has gone up 257% basically in 30 years. much faster than inflation or middle class incomes. why is that happening? >> well, the government keeps on pouring more money into higher ed, keeps on pouring subsidies, keeps on raising the costs, is it really unexpected? >> normal incentive if you're going to put more money into an industry, the cost of that industry, that product or service going up. >> that's right, these colleges are using the money basically to finance these megastadiums, these nice dorm facilities, along with these really high salaries for these executives. >> proliferation of administrators as well is part of the problem or not? >> that's probably one of the biggest drivers. at some colleges there are moreadministrators than there are faculties. >> the president's plan, what is he going to do about it? >> what he's going to do is start ranking colleges as to how much educational bang for the buck they offer to -- if you're a college or university and you're doing a good job, they will award you more funding, and if you're not doing a good job, they will take away funding. i hope that the obama administration realizes that -- academic leftists and people on the right who don't like government interference saying this is not another industry that washington ought to take over. >> he is an optimist, isn't he, that that's going to happen? that's why we love you, james. >> there is a problem, parents are finally pushing back against the incredible cost that theyhave been paying for all these years. so finally the fat is in the fire and the question is who's going to get to the solution quicker t president, the government or the private sector? >> does the president's plan have a chance to work, do you think? >> the problem is that the president's plan is essentially to allow these students to forgive their loans after ten years. that's his income based repayment plan. >> if you decide to go to work in the nonprofit sector, or for government, you can actually write off your loans after ten years. >> what happens if you're someone like you who went to work for the private sector, you don't get that same benefit, do you? >> no, unfortunately. >> but i think that tells you what the danger is on this ranking, though, the president's made it very clear, government now saying we're going to give you a good deal on loans if you do nonprofit work or work in government. the same danger on the courseside or the academic side, the government's going to be deciding what courses to teach.   when we come back, hits and misses of the week. reinforced with scratch- resistant glass and a unibody made kevlar strong. okay google now. call my droid. the new droid ultra by motorola. when strength matters, droid does. i'm bethand i'm michelle. and we own the paper cottage. it's a stationery and gifts store. anything we purchase for the paper cottage goes on our ink card. so you can manage your business expenses and access them online instantly with the game changing app from ink. we didn't get into business to spend time managing receipts, that's why we have ink. we like being in business because we like being creative, we like interacting with people.so you have time to focus on the things you love. infrom chase. so you can.time for hits and miss of the week. >> the department of health and human services and its medical research team claimed that the sequester forced him to end a research project on curing blindness and his test project bunny rack ny rabbits. i know that earlier this month it was reported that hhs is preserving from the sequester cuts all obamacare outreach efforts. so i think we can agree that those are the wrong priorities. >> this is a hit for eric holder, the attorney general forhis announcement that he will initiate more probes in the large financial firms that played a role in the subprime financial crisis. and i'm excited about this because i know for sure this means he's finally going after fannie mae for its role in the junk bonds and also it's possible that he's going to go after citibank, where his treasury secretary used to work. >> surpassing freeman. >> paul a hit for two slivers of evidence that the culture may not be doomed yet. the first is that anthony weiner the mayoral candidate who was in first place after his recent revelations is in last place. the second is that oprah winfrey was going to interview the troubled actress lindsay lohan and nobody showed up to watch. some may say we're bouncing off the bottom with the culture, but i'm going to allow myself a ray of hope. >> who says conservatives are pessimists, this"

for ""the fox report"" tomorrow night. the o'reilly factor is coming up now. have a great one. >> bill: the o'reilly factor is on. tonight: [machine gunfire. [sthvment- >> watch yourself rbg backlash. >> bill: brutal report out today that the cia leader is bribing afghanistan and allies. millions of dollars of cash is being handed to. they brit hume and i will analyze. >> let's say you went into labor, the membranes ruptured and you delivered before we got to the termination part of the procedure here then we would would not help it. >> bill: undercover investigation spotlights two more abortion clinics that will not save babies born alive. >> what if his leg popped out at home? >> flush it.>> my former advisors switched offer to the dark side, for example, david axelrod now works for msnbc which is a mace change of pace since msnbc used to work for david axelrod. >> bill: also tonight, the factor's excellent journey to washington over the weekend with the national media remains enthralled with the president. >> rush limbaugh warned you about the second term, baby. >> bill: caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. the factor begins right now. >> bill: hi, i'm bill o'reilly. thanks for watching us tonight. the excellent venture to washington, d.c. that's the subject of tonight's talking points memo. we have a lot to tell you tonight. it's all over the place i apologize in advance.every year they the white house holds a dinner for kids who don't have very much money so they can attend journalism school. this year fox news white house correspondent ed henry, a good guy, was in charge. henry did a very nice job raising about $300,000 for the students as part of the event, president obama gets to make fun of everybody, including himself. >> these days i look in the mirror and i have to admit i'm not the strapping young muslim socialist that i used to be. [ laughter ] i know republicans are still sorting out what happened in 2012. one thing they do agree on they need to do a better job reaching out to minorities. call me self-centered. i could think of one minority they could start with. hello. [ laughter ] [ applause ]think of me as a trial run, you know. see how it goes. this whole trophy billion jay-z going to cuba it's up believable i have 99 problems and now jay-z is 1. that's another rap reference, bill. >> bill: well, i must thank the president for the heads up. sorry to say i am not down with the jay-z song 99 problems. but if it's half as good as cara by jay and the americans i think i'm going to like it. then conan o'brien took to the podium. >> the demographics of this country have been rapidly changing over the past two decades and i look forward to hosting this event 18 years from now. then my opening line will be. [speaking spanish]president mario lopez. >> hello to fox news star bill o'reilly. he has become quite the author. two best sellers killing kennedy and killing lincoln. he wrote a book not nearly as popular ""the natural peaceful death of taft."" what were you thinking? the truth is bill o'reilly, and this is true, is now working on next book due out this fall this time it's about the killing of jesus. it will be the first time in history jesus' death is blamed on obama care. [ laughter ] >> bill: wow, conan, thanks for the publicity, man. nice of you. watching that tape you may have noticed i was signature next to supreme court justice antonin scalia. that was fascinating but all off the record. what i can tell is you that scalia is really a no spin zone guy. loves his country and has stayed true to ethnic rootsin queens, new york. he was giving me jazz about the killing jesus book but i will win them over, i hope. then after the dinner the schmoozing began and i'm not very good at that and neither is barbra streisand who is at the dinner but everybody was kept away from her. i have to be honest, i'm not getting the entire streisand deal. yeah, she is a good singer. so what? but ms. streisand certainly the diva of the evening. most of the other celebrities were more down to earth. i met katy perry. very nice woman. sophia couldn't be nicer. and hayden who i once called a pinhead on this program. but she is not. she is very intelligent and well-spoken. all right so that was that now the serious stuff. the primary reason i went down to the big dog and pony show was to help ed henry and fox news correspondent jennifer griffin. she is working with the independence fund to help u.s. military people who lost limbs in iraq andafghanistan. some of them lost all four limbs. we want to get these brave patriots this high tech marvel, it's called the chair. a it allows amputees the semblance of independence. the chair can go everywhere. into the woods, on the beach. it gives amputees a bit of control over their lives and lessens their dependence. that's crucial, crucial to these brave men and women. chairs cost more than $10,000 each and jennifer and i want to get at least 50 more of them. so we have developed a program that could raise an enormous amount of money. i can't tell you about it right now, but it is really interesting concept. however, i had to get president obama on board with that program. and i did. mr. obama is going to help with the track chairs. again, i will give you the details a bit down the road. also, i got to go to the washington nationals game where they honor wounded u.s. military people at every game in the third inning and we salute theirowner ted learner a patriot for doing that all in all it was a very productive weekend in washington, can i say. it's been enormous change since i began attending these dinners 15 years ago. fox news now in the forefront of everything. tv ratings during the terror bombing proved that and certainly we were a force at that dinner. but now, now we have even more of an obligation to use our power for the good of the nation. these wounded warriors who lost their limbs on the battlefield, we must help them. not an option. the high tech we have in this country is fantastic. and we will get those track chairs for those heros. and that is really the most important thing that i can do and fox news is helping me do it and jennifer griffin is a saint. and that's the memo. in a moment, we will bring in bernie goldberg and talk about how the press continues to treat president obama who was on display in washington over the weekend. it's fascinating. goldberg is next.with hotwire's low prices, we can afford to take an extra trip this year. first boston... then san francisco. hotwire checks the competitions' rates every day so they can guarantee their low prices. so our hotels were half price. ♪ h-o-t-w-i-r-e... ♪ hotwire.comú0 everybody has different ideas, goals, appetite for risk. you can't say 'one size fits all'. it doesn't. that's crazy. we're all totally different. ishares core. etf building blocks for your personalized portfolio. find out why 9 out of 10 large professional investors choose ishares for their etfs. ishares by blackrock. call 1-800-ishares for a prospectus, which includes investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. read and consider it carefully before investing. risk includes possible loss of principal. a brand new start. your chance to rise and shine. with centurylink as your trusted technology partner, you can do just that. with our visionary cloud infrastructure, global broadband network and custom communications solutions, your business is more reliable - secure - agile. and with responsive, dedicated support, we help you shine every day of the week.got come about goldberg. any headline you saw from the correspondent's dinner? >> well, a couple of pieces of news, i think. one was that wayne lappier of the national rifle association and the billionaire conservative coke brothers were thespecial guests at the msnbc table. >> bill: no they weren't. >> no i made that up. second ching which you mentioned in your talking points and i think it bears repeating because it's so important is that conan o'brien revealed that in killing jesus you contend that jesus died because of obama care. i found that fascinating. >> bill: not true. >> while we're talking about books. i have a book coming out soon and i hope you will plug it it's called ""killing garfield."" it's a real page-turner. >> bill: already written by what's her name the good historian out of kansas, i believe. but, look, what i picked up here at the correspondent's dinner were two things. lack of g.o.p. presence. very few republicans there the press is not skeptical of president obama.you have written a book about him. slobbering obama care. along liberal lines. president obama is a liberal. most of the preg press is liberals. they like him. there is no skepticism anymore, bernie, about the failure of certain policies. it's like okay, so what? so what? so what the economy remains -- so what afghanistan is going down the drain and we have that in a couple of minutes? so what? that's what -- >> right. a couple of points on that. you mentioned in the lead-in to this segment that they like him. you are absolutely right. and never underestimate the power of likability in any facet of life. they have a lot invested in him. when i wrote that book a slobbering love affair, i interviewed a network news correspondent who said don't expect the press to go after nelson mandela. and i said what does nelson mandela have to do with this? they said a lot of journalists see barack obama as nelson mandela.is he a hero. is he a historic figure. they didn't simply want to be eyewitnesses to history. they wanted to help define history. and they have so much invested in him they won't be sceptic call, not now, not ever. >> bill: you know, i think that's an excellent analogy, instead of mandela, there is somebody better that is desmond tutu who is allied of course with nelson mandela in the civil rights of south africa. tutu is a reared figure but communist and said very outrageous things about capitalism and the united states and gets a total pass and i do believe you are right. that's what's going on here. that it doesn't really matter about public policy anymore. to the press. >> no. and here's where that becomes very, very important. a mainstream journalist, not some right wing nut or anything like that, mark halperin of time magazine, i have mentioned this to you before, but it's important enough to sayagain, mark al principal said and this is -- hall said hall said the media is very susceptible to doing what the obama campaign wants. why is that important? because the obama campaign wanted benghazi to use one example to go away. and the mainstream media pretty much helped it go away. that's where the lack of skepticism comes in. if they do what he wants, and that's different from liberal bias. that becomes something more. you are on to something here. >> bill: absolutely and here. >> activism. >> bill: here is how it is going to effect the country going forward. that the press then drops all skepticism. for example, the story that we're working on for tomorrow about the terrorists in boston who is -- who the interview with the fbi is interrupted because here comes the u.s. attorney to mirandize andthe fbi doesn't know anything about it. nobody covers it nobody is covering it. all right? because it then ties into eric holder. it ties into barack obama. it ties into the world view of terrorism. and they ignore it. this is a big story. we'll have it tomorrow because we're doing a lot of things on it but, down the road, barack obama is going to set up the democratic party, particularly the liberal ring of it to continue his legacy and the press is just going to go right along that track for the next election. >> yeah. because in his case, they are not going to do anything to disrupt the legacy of a historic figure. >> bill: right. >> i guarantee you, as liberal as the media are, if he were walter mondale, al gore, john kerry, you know, any one of those regular run of the mill liberal democrats, they wouldn't be quite as kindto him as they are because of what he represents. and they have humiliated themselves in the first campaign. they continue to do so. their credibility -- they're willing to put their credibility out there and sacrifice it because they are so in love with barack obama. they were then. they are now. and they will be for the rest of his presidency. they will. >> bill: that was certainly on display over the weekend. bernie, thanks very much. as always, directly ahead juan williams who was my body guard in d.c. will explain why he was arrested on saturday night. only kidding. williams on the liberal press moments away. ♪hey everybody, hi mom... streaming live with a tour of my new place... knowing you can still reach out. ... and now you've seen it. that's powerful. verizon. get mom a lucid 2 by lg for free. ♪ the joint is jumpin' ♪ it's really jumpin' ♪ ♪ come in, cats ♪ and check your hats ♪ i mean this joint ijumpin' [ male announcer ] osteo bi-flex helps revitalize your joints to keep 'em jumpin'.° like calcium supplements can help your bones osteo bi-fle n help your joints. ♪ osteo bi-flex... the best stuff in the joint. now in joint and muscle formula for people that demand even more for their bodies.>> bill: in the impact segment tonight, one of the striking things about the white house correspondence dinner was the lack of republicans in the room as i mentioned. governor christie was there and few other g.o.p.ers. not a conservative house. >> there was confusion with the seating chart. for a moment, someone accidently sat governor chris christie with the republicans. that was awkward and i apologize. >> bill: christie was with the huffington post a very left wing outfit. joining us from washington always per perspicacious is juan williams. mary katharine ham is off tonight. given up the policies of the obama administration and that's going to carry into the next election for the house and senate. and on to the election the presidential election of 200116. am i wrong is goldberg wrong. >> i think you guys are wrong on this. the press can be fawning at times. when you heard thepresident say you know the press' job is to keep him humble. his job is to be president and he is doing better than they're. i think he knows that he gets a pretty friendly treatment from the press. where you are going wrong is, look, at the same dinner, he talked about how there was that picture of him skeet shooting out of camp david and everybody immediately said it's photo shopped, it's a conspiracy. he never ever did that before the gun control debate he put up picture of him on top of some go daddy car. he hears all these conspiracy theories. maureen dowd, liberal columnist, ""new york times"" says he doesn't know how to be -- you know what, maureen, that was a liberal fantasy. a liberal fantasy. wake up. you look at the press today, bill, what do you see? oh, obama lost the gun control. they never mentioned g.o.p. flible, now you have to have 60 votes to passanything? this is unprecedented in american history. >> bill: there are certain facts like the weather. it's raining. he lost the vote. come on. juan, you can't sit there and say that there is a healthy -- wait, wait, wait, juan. wait. you can't sit there and tell me in the nation and millions of people watching around the world that you believe there is a healthy skepticism on the part of the press which is the definition of the press as far as the obama administration is concerned. come on. >> well, let me tell you, the american people, when they are asked who is out of touch, close to half say obama is out of touch. get, this 70% say the congress, republican majority in the house specifically, you look at their ratings in the tank, barely double digits, bill. >> bill: what does that have to do with what we are talking about? >> when you say people are fawning about president obama and to a large degree i agree, it is not the whole story. any time there is an internet conspiracy coming from the right, it'simmediately reflected in the prints presence. >> no, it's not. and social media drives that stuff. can i give you 10 examples of crazy right wing fantasy conspiracy theories that never see the light of day. look, you are at my table. the only good news is the sea change about fox news. >> oh man no, question about that the reason that is happening is we stand alone here at fnc in bringing skepticism to the president. we tell the folks when he does something right. i do at least. and then when he does something wrong we say that but you are not going to get that on the other networks, very -- that's got to be critical mass. it's got to be all over the place for those people to weigh in at all. you know what i'm talking about. >> yeah, i do. i think that you are right. clearly fox is where you can see legitimate journalism taking place in terms of adversarialposture towards those in power. >> bill: right. that's a key word. the press is is supposed to adversarial towards those in power. but it's not, juan, in the case of barack obama no but i think bernie was leading you down the right path when he said this guy is iconic. >> bill: make any excuse you want but it's the same posture that jfk had. it's almost identical. the press covered for president kennedy. they loved him personally. >> yeah. camelot. >> bill: they didn't bring skepticism to him. i proved that yard in killing kennedy. all right, juan. thanks a lot for the tickets by the way. juan set me up there in the game. you did a big favor for the veterans. when they stood up in the third or fourth inning there was bill o'reilly it was my pleasure to do that. >> bill: i got a free hat out of it, too. >> bill: good day all around for the vets. good day. plenty more ahead as the factor it moves along thisevening. very disturbing report for the ""new york times"" as mentioned the cia is bribing the afghan leader karzai and allies with millions of dollars in cash. brit hume on that. then a shocking undercover report about abortion clinics where babies born alive may be allowed to die right in front of the mother. we hope you stay tuned to to those reports. the soreness was excruciating. it was impossible to even think about dancing. when you're dancing, your partner is holding you. so, his hand would have been right in the spot that i had the shingles. no tango. no rhumba. you can't be touched. for more of the inside story, visit shinglesinfo.com♪ [ male announcer ] sixty-two horsepower. fifty-three miles per hour. the gator rsx 850i. it's a whole new species of gator. the gator rsx 850i. i'my body doesn't work the way it used to. past mprime?

joining us now from washington fox news senior political analyst brit hume. we call the cia. of course, they are not going to comment on anything. that's what the cia does. very disturbing and i don't think that we should be spending all this blood and treasure on corrupt criminals and if they are accepting bags of millions of dollars of cash. what else could they be well this is the question whether this is the sort of thing cia does. yes it is did. if afghanistan is a place to care about. there was a time we needed to care about afghanistan. then we have to have influence there. you get it however you can get it if you have iran in there bidding on karzai's loyalty, perhaps we have to bid, too.it looks as if one of the problems with this guy is he doesn't stay bought but he certainly didn't stay bought for iran which apparently gave him a great deal of money the same way we did. when it came time for military agreement he signed with us. >> bill: brit, what you are saying is and i know you are being realistic and this is what happens in the world. we have been there more than 10 years now. >> what is your objection? we're too good a country to be involved in a corrupt thing like paying bribes to foreign leaders? >> bill: here is my beef. we're in business with a gangster. karzai is a gangster. he has other gangsters who he pays off to do whatever. swns we leave what do you think is going to happen? the whole thing is going to collapse like south vietnam did. that's what's going to happen. >> i understand that well, i understand that's a possibility i don't rule that out. i can't predict the future.>> bill: is he not a gangster karzai? elected leader fighting for the freedom of his country. is he taking bag money under the table. not only that, but the country afghanistan is the leading exporter of heroin in the world. is he a gangster. bill. >> look, there are parts of the world where you are choosing among gangsters. if you want to do business with whoever is there, you are going to be doing business with gangster. that's part of the business you have cia. >> bill: if we're going to do business with a gangster, because it's our tax money and the military's blood that's propping this gangster up. >> i understand that would you rather have us prop him up or iran prop him up? >> bill: i would rather have him out of there. is there not an honest afghan? >> do you imagine that he is out of there the next war lord who steps in to fill the vacuum by his departure is going to be less of a gangster and more of a friend to the united states? >> bill: i'm hoping there is one honest military person in this that country who could run the country on interim basis and get itunder control. one. i'm hoping there is one. maybe there isn't. >> i think that might be a fond help, bill. >> bill: well, you know, and that is a mess. here is the bigger question. should the united states get involved when our people are dying and being maimed with a country that there isn't anybody honest in it. you know what? sorry. we will use the drones if they reconstitute we will blow the hell out of the sky. >> i understand that, bill. the question is really not whether -- look, afghanistan is not going to be turned into switzerland. it's just not look where afghanistan was when the united states intervened there, completely lawless place run by war lords and mostly run by the taliban who are our morality enemies. taliban gave sanctuary and place of comfort and base of operations to al qaeda which is definitely our enemy. routed al qaeda to the extinct we could. taliban taken from power. and the situation there at least as far as ourinterests are concerned are better now than it was then. good place? make it switzerland? no does it make it better? is that not part of what the cia's co-verdict operations do? i think the answer may be yet. >> bill: i'm not sure. the french ambassador to afghanistan recently left to take over the french secret service and his parting remarks he said number one, they are all gangsters, he said exactly what i'm saying and they are all involved in the heroin trade which is killing more people than terrorism in europe right now which is true. and number two, as soon as the money stops, the united states bribe money, the millions of dollars we are giving them, these guys are going to take off. they are not going to hang there. the taliban will come waltzing back in. you know what? it's hard to argue with that. >> certainly hard to argue with that when we are withdrawing our military presence there. which is one of the reasons the taliban haven't come back -- the question is then, without a military presence there, what do we have to keep the government on our side? it would appear that one ofthe things we have is cash. >> bill: you know there, comes a point where they have enough cash. karzai has been stealing money and his brother is in the drug trade. you figure they have enough to buy anything they want to buy on this earth. it just -- it just -- look, i get it, you have got to choose your villains sometimes. all right? >> right. >> bill: this is a dirty business. >> exactly. but it's wrong on a million different levels. once you get in business with the devil, you know mockvelly said you are going to it dine with the devil bring a long spoon you are never going to win. we are never going to win over there. >> all i have to say about that, bill, that sounds like a great wise saying and an adage for the ages except for the fact that in many places all around the world where we have interests, the choice is not between someone like karzai and some paragon, the choice is somebody like karzai and somebody worse. >> bill: all right. and that's true. i cannot argue with that. but the folks should knowwhat's going on over there. we are backing gangsters in afghanistan. brit hume, everybody. when we come right back, it is open season on babies here in the u.s.a. as some american abortion clinics are doing horrible things. we have a shocking undercover report in just a few moments. home for the big family reunion. you must be garth's father?

>> sure. the main point of thisinvestigation, bill, is to show that inhuman and abusive practices the brutality of abortion in america. what we have allowed our nation to come to to be supporting an industry that is brutalizing children old enough to survive outside the womb in the womb and even with those blurred lines killing children in these clinics that survive failed abortion attempts and struggling for lives at the hands of the abortionist. >> bill: planned parenthood and naral says that's the extreme. we are responsible people and wield never do that if the baby were birthed we would never leave it to die. that's what they are going to say? >> we have to call them out and say these groups naral and planned parenthood are arguing against every abortion regulation in the book. they are arguing abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, children that are old enough to survive outside the womb. arguing for taxpayers to fund abortion. that's the abortion extremism that we are seeing and it's led by the white house sadly by ourown president. >> bill: well, sure. we should say that in new york state, after 24 weeks, you can't have an abortion unless the woman -- the woman's life is in danger. >> hospital, um-huh. >> bill: in washington you can have an abortion any time any place in d.c. they have no restrictions at all. but you are right. the pro-choice lobby doesn't want any restrictions. they want to abort. and then even after the baby is birthed. they don't see it as a baby. >> right. >> bill: to me is the story. even after you have a baby on -- in the doctor's arms they don't see it as a baby. >> there is three things that people see when they come away from these films. these films are heart-breaking. they are shocking but three things. first of all the brutality of abortion. >> bill: everybody knows that lila, do they not. >> i don't think so. people. >> >> bill: to terminate a fetus in the wound is a destructive act? >> we have sanitized the term. we have politicized the term. i think we have forgotten what abortion really is we fight for the rights ofanimals and environment but we have forgotten the womb is supposed to be a place of safety and compassion and love and instead we turned it into a place where the most destruction happens in our country. almost a third of children in our country are killed by abortion. these are the numbers we have allowed. this investigation illustrates the inhumanity of it. it also illustrates how easily it leads to infant sides how that does and can happen. clinic workers seem to have corporate knowledge of it it and abortionist. to be honest the doctor says -- >> bill: 90% of american obgyn's won't festival abortions. this doctor you have got in d.c. but, you know, we saw it with tiller out in kansas and seen it in philadelphia and this guy here. i want people to know that you are a privately run organization. no government funds of course?

i'm jig jig and welcome to america's news headquarters. >> arthel: i'm arthel neville. topping the news, new word from the white house on the president meeting with his natural security team reportedly considering all option in response to reports of the deadly chemical attack in syria. we'll get a live report from washington. >> gregg: and brand-new allegations of abuse coming out of the nsa scandal. this time involving workers spying on love interests. really? didn't we used to call that stalking? we've got details. >> we are today standing in the midst of that eternal flame. if we could all but catch a flicker from that ferocious planof freedom, we could each light a small candle with courage and in our own voice cry out, this little light of mine. i'm gonna let it shine! >> arthel: and remembering a dream. events this weekend recalling the reverend dr. martin luther king, junior's leading the famous march on washington 50 summers ago that changed america forever.   we begin with this fox news alert. the west is on fire with little sign of help from mother nature. about 200 square miles burning along the edge of california's yosemite national park. san francisco in a state of emergency with power and water supplies threatened. more than 2500 firefighters are battling the blaze, but they're not even close to bringing the so-called rim fire under control. several homes are destroyed and thousands more threatened. mixed relief in idaho as storms drop rainwater on a fire nearsun valley. but lightning sparked new blazes. let's go to dominic dinatale. in northern california, a city is threatened and it's threatening san francisco. give us the details, dominic. >> certainly. yeah. the weather here is getting hot this afternoon and that's going to keep the fire going. they're saying this could jump out of its containment area partly due to bad weather. the big worry is what might happen in san francisco. part of the yosemite park caught fire near one of the major dams that provides 85% of the water supply to san francisco. on top of that, some of the power lines coming out of this area that also feed the city have been affected by the fire. the governor, jerry brown, saying it might disrupt both power and water supplies. they're already taking power from elsewhere on the grid because some of the power had to be taken off line. we're not sure how far it couldgo. tomorrow expecting bad weather if the winds pick up and that could send the fire in any direction. right now we've got an extra 2,000 firefighters that have been brought in today alone to fry prevent damages to property here. obviously to the utility life lines to the city of san francisco. >> arthel: and it could send the wind in so many directions. it's one of the fastest moving fires so far this season. so far, how much acreage are we talking about that's been scorched? >> we're looking at 125,000 acres. what's happened is that number hasn't really changed for the past 15, 20 hours or so. but what has happened, there were spots, interior islands they call them, inside the area that hadn't been burned. that's what the fire has been doing. we're hearing from the firefighters they're having to actively tackle those areas, as well as try and defend the homes here. take a listen. this is what one of the fire officials described the fight that they're facing at the moment. take a listen. >> right now we're look atshifting winds this evening, which are not going to be in our favor. that's why we moved equipment here and other areas. tonight will be a difficult fight for us. we prepped the area, putting contingency lines and have firefighters at the ready. but tonight is definitely going to be a battle. >> i got to say, we were talking early, and there was a look of sincere concern on his face. protect. we'll see how they do. updates later in the afternoon. >> arthel: not a good situation right now. let's hope for the best. thank you very much for that live report there. >> gregg: aren't the big problem -- a big problem is the weather is not cooperating with the fires. we're talk being low humidity and gusty winds, high temperatures, all making for extreme weather conditions. let's get the latest from our meteorologist, janis dean. what do you see? >> i wish i had better news. a lot of this area is mountsenous terrain. the firefighters are having ahard time get not guilty there because of the mountains. they didn't receive the snow pack they typically receive in the wintertime. so that has led to more dry brush and the fire has really exploded within the last 24 hours. so taking a look at the forecast, temperatures, a little bit cool, but as dominic mentioned, winds gusting from 15 to 20 to 25 miles per hour. when you have a fire this size, it's erratic. it can create its own winds. sunday not much difference here. lot of sunshine, very dry conditions and only 5% containment. we do have a tropical storm offshore in the pacific. we were hoping we would get some of the moisture to move into this region. however, it is skipping the san francisco and yosemite area. you can see the moisture filtering in to the southwest. really not getting into the area that we really needed. so ivo is the tropical storm offshore. all of that moisture is being pumped in, but for southern california and the southwest,and there is yosemite, it doesn't look like we'll get any help from mother nature in this region. because the moisture is coming into the southwest and areas that can't deal with so much rain in a short period of time, we're going to be dealing with flooding in this area. so flash flood watches and warnings are posted. another quick dangerous situation is we are dealing with extreme heat across the upper midwest. look at these temperatures right now. 89 in minneapolis. 96 in north platte. you factor in the humidity, what it feels like. it feels liked 5 in minneapolis. 98 in sioux falls. we could set some records here. heat advisories for all of the states here, where the heat index will feel from 95 to 105 for the next several days. around the minneapolis area, that's where we have excessive heat warning. you can see the temperatures here as we head into monday, tuesday. still very warm. really dangerous. people are urged to stay indoors. especially check on the elderly and your pets and keep an eye onthe little ones as well. we'll keep you posted. back to you. >> gregg: all right. thanks very much. >> you bet. >> arthel: weather not a factor in dc where crowds are gathering to commemorate reverend martin luther king, junior's ""i have a dream"" speech. that speech was the highlight of the 1963 march on washington for jobs and freedom. the crowds retracing that march ahead of the events 50th anniversary. elizabeth prann has more now from the lincoln memorial. >> thousands are descending on the national mall this weekend to remember the original march on washington where a quarter of a million gathered to protest racial inequality and unemployment. so many of the folks here were part of the original march. they packed bus, cars and trains to get here. almost five decades ago. much of the celebrations today center around the late martin luther king, junior's iconic speech. it was highlighted in almost every aspect of the event. >> you celebrate the joy of our progress, the freedom from barbarism and the right to vote.we celebrate the joy of our political progress. >> while many of the speakers had huge progress, they still say more can be done. >> we american because every economic indicator shows gaping white-black disparities. we march for freedom from white supremacy. still we have work to do. none of it is easy. >> events are scheduled throughout the week. and the president planned a speech here for wednesday. arthel, back to you. >> arthel: elizabeth prann, thank you very much. >> gregg: fox news alert. we are now hearing from the white house as the president wraps up a meeting with top national security advisors on the escalating crisis in syria. u.s. warships in position now off of syria as the president reportedly considers a potential response to a suspected chemical weapons attack against civilians. molly henneberg is live in washington. we understand the president talked to another world leadertoday. who was it? >> hi, gregg. we're just getting this word in that the president had some sort of call with u.k. prime minister, david cameron, to talk about the continued violence in syria. this is just breaking now, that the two men talked about -- they expressed their grave concern, the white house says, about the reported use of chemical weapons by the syrian regime. the two men, president obama and prime minister cameron, said they would continue to consult closely about this incident, as well as, quote, possible responses by the international community. as far as the u.s.'s own response, the navy has sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern mediterranean sea, according to defense officials. chuck hagel says the pentagon has a responsibility to prepare for whatever the president decides to do. he told reporters yesterday, quote, we are always having to prepare as we give the president options, prepare our assets and where they are and the capability of those assets to carry out contingencies we givethe president. as to the time line, i didn't subject myself to any kind of time line other than this will be dealt with. i suspect some decisions within a short amount of time. the president met with his national security team today in and a white house official says the president and his team will act, quote, very deliberately once they get the facts about what happened in syria this week. gregg? >> gregg: you know, facts are a tricky thing because you have to verify what occurred. so how is the white house going to get those facts? >> that's difficult, as you were just alluding to, in a country like syria. the white house says today in a release we just got that the u.s. intelligence community is working to, quote, ascertain what happened. there is also a united nations investigative team on the ground in syria trying to determine if chemical weapons were used. the president's team wants to hear from them. today the u.n.'s disarm a amount chief arrived to press syrian president assad's government to allow that investigative team to go to the site of the reportedchemical attack. here is u.n. secretary general moon. >> any use of chemical weapons by anybody under any circumstances would violate international law. such a crime against humanity should result in serious consequence for them. >> president obama said reports about a chemical attack are, quote, very troublesome. gregg? >> gregg: yeah. the video seems to speak volumes. molly, thanks very much. fox news national security analyst k.t. mcfarland will be here to give us her take on the possibility of the u.s. military strike in syria in just a bit. >> arthel: new reports about woeful misconduct by the national security agency, some of the nsa employees reportedly spied on their love interests. officials at the agency sayingit wasn't frequent and most of the incidents were self-reported. just last week the nsa admitted it had violated privacy rules. thousands of times each year. feel better? >> gregg: i don't know what that means. >> arthel: i don't know what to make of that. >> gregg: i won't comment. new details on the death of an australian baseball player in oklahoma. horrible story as investigators try to find out why he was targeted by three teen-agers. >> arthel: another horrific attack carried out by teens as well. how a world war ii veteran lost his life. that's coming up next. >> what is this world coming to anyway? raising a bunch of idiots! i mean, how would they like somebody to do that to them when they get 88 years old? dad. how

joining us now is fox news national security analyst, k.t. mcfarland, served as deputy assistant secretary of defense during the reagan administration. so k.t. knows a thing or two. good to see you. >> good to see you. >> arthel: let's start with this, is this the right strategy? will it get assad's attention? also, i think you believe that you get into position, but don't move just yet. >> yeah. you want to be there in case you're needed, but i don't think just by sending warships into the region, president assad will decide, i'm not going to use any more chemical weapons against mypeople, if he's been using them. i think what we need to do is to first have a couple of sort of perquisites. first, do no harm. we don't want to send boots on the ground in the middle east. we've seen how that worked out in the last two wars we've fought and it's not clear if we did send boots on the ground that it would be successful. the other thing is people have said, let's just arm the rebels. the rebels are predominantly al-qaeda. so we don't want to give them weapons that they might ultimately turn around and use against us. so first do no harm. i think the second thing that molly henneberg has reported, the president talked to the prime minister of great britain. the brits and the french, have they been way out in front of us, as have the israelis. they have all said if chemical weapons are use, we should respond with force. so whatever we do, we don't want to do it alone. we want to do it as part of a coalition. >> arthel: continue. >> i think the other thing to remember, though, is thatwhatever we do, whether it's a missile strike or whether it's bombing or whether it's covert operations or sabotage, we want to make sure that we've got a high likelihood of success. also proof that they've actually used them. the videos which are horrible to watch, as an american, you look at that and say, we've got to do something about this. other countries don't necessarily feel that way. >> arthel: why don't they feel that way? can we believe the video? the video is horrible. i got to tell you. we're showing it right now. i can never watch the monitor when the video is on. so what more do we need to see in terms of drawing us and whoever else needs to walk in lock step with the u.s. into action? >> i think there are u.n. inspector there is for the first time in a long time. there are chemicals weapons inspectors. they know what to look for. they will be looking for that. presumably there are groups we are working with on the ground. things like hair samples or tissue sample, blood samples, we will be able to tell from that whether chemical weapons havebeen used. the whole point of this is you got to be effective. i don't think the united states belongs in the middle of syria's civil war. however, if there are chemical weapons being used, particularly chemical weapons which would fall into the hands of people who would use them against us, then we may have an interest in destroying or capturing those chemical weapons. >> arthel: how do you do that? >> that's presumely what they're meeting at the white house situation room about right now. for example, you could have missile strikes. they would keep u.s. ships not over the syrian air space, but in the mediterranean, fire missiles and destroy those chemical weapons. presumably we know where they are. the israelis, for example, have said, if they see those chemical weapons moving across the border from syria into lebanon where they might be used against israel, israel reserves the right to attack those. i assume if israel says that, they know where they are. someone has to know where they are and potentially we coulddestroy them. but again, i don't think anybody is talking about boots on the ground. i sure hope not. >> arthel: it will be interesting, inspectors are there. see what happens. thanks kt. >> thanks. reinforced with scratch- resistant glass and a unibody made kevlar strong. okay google now. call my droid. the new droid ultra by motorola. when strength matters, droid does. to fly home for the big family reunion. you must be garth's father?

>> i feel like a super hero, like you got the healing cell. >> without her consent, scientists in baltimore beared her cells and used them after she died from cervical cancer in 1951; we got to maintain some kind of control over the information 'cause we don't know what damage it did. >> the family is thrilled with the scientific progress, but remain concerned that the grim history of experimentation on african-americans and the poor not be forgotten. this is the humble home of henrietta lax, where she lived adifficult life, where she raised her children. never knowing that one day her cancerous cells would change the entire scientific world and save so many lives. dr. francis collins, director of the national institutes of health and former head of the human genome project, helped broker a deal between the nih and lax family. they will not be paid, but will have some control of the cells. >> individuals should have the opportunity to decide how their own biological specimens are going to be used and what privacy protections they need. that's one principle. the other is that science advances for public benefit most quickly if data is accessible and you don't put up unnecessary barrier. >> some people feel like their soul is in these cells and their family's dna is in these cells and it's a personal thing and it gets to the questions of where does life begin and ends? the question is essentially we need to tell people that.she was phenomenal in her lifetime and she is phenomenal after death. >> in baltimore, maryland, dr. mark siegle, fox news. >> arthel: fascinating story. thanks, dr. siegle. stick with fox news channel for special events commemorating dr. martin luther king, junior's ""i have a dream"" speech. wednesday marks 50 years since he delivered one of the most famous speeches in u.s. history. we're going to take you live to the national mall in washington, that's coming up momentarily. stick right here. have 4 grams of fiber! to help support gularity! i want some...

answer me! what are you gonna do about it? >> he drew a crowd around him here. evidence that a lot of people here pay very close to say what their elders were having to say and having great respect for their elders in the battles that they fought in trying to overcome the segregation and the jim crow laws of their era. i asked a young dad holding his baby what this march meant to him. listen up. >> really like thinking about my dad, he was two at the time. my mom was just being born. and just knowing that 50 years ago that they were just kids like my kids themselves. and just to be part of this is just a monumental thing.>> generational continuity and a great appreciation for the legacy of events in great abundance here today. >> gregg: you know, i was a kid at the time and i watched it on an old black and white tv in our living room and i remember it so well. black and white photos today compared to what's been going on, what are the differences? >> one thing i noticed look at those old television images, and especially at some of the black and white stillages from that era, you notice how people were dressed on that hot august day. most of the men, i'm not speak of the speakers, but the people in the crowd. the men were dressed in coat and ties. the women very, very elegantly dressed. that's a statement to me, that they were seeking the dignity that was deprived them through some of these laws. the other thing i noticed today is the erie similarity of the messages that they were preaching.that gentleman we just talked to, 94-year-old andrew allison said -- i didn't use the sound bite. i didn't want to use it, but he said, this is still a racist country. that's controversial. that is very much the subject of the debate. there are people who say that what followed after that 1963 march, especially lyndon johnson's great society did more to propel the cycle of dependentence in african-american homes, which is worse today than it was back then, in fact, it spread beyond the black inner city culture to the culture at large, across all the western states. not just united states, but western culture, european culture as well. food for thought, greg. >> gregg: doug, as always, thank you so much. appreciate it. >> arthel: news alert now. we're hearing from the white house as the president wraps up a meeting with his top national security advisors on the escalating crisis in syria. u.s. warships are in position aspresident obama reportedly considers a potential response to a suspected chemical weapons attack against civilians. bringing in molly henneberg now live in washington. so molly, the white house says that the president intends to act, quote, very deliberately when it comes to syria. do we know at this point what this means? >> the white house says the u.s. intelligence community is working to, quote, ascertain what happened in syria and president obama also is waiting to hear from a united nations team on the ground in syria investigating reports that chemical weapons were used earlier this week before he makes a decision about how the u.s. will respond. in the meantime, defense secretary chuck hagel traveling in asia told reporters yesterday, quote, the defense department has a responsibility to provide the president with options for all contingencies and that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets to be able to carry out different options. whatever options the president might choose. part of that positioning,according to the officials, means the navy has sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern mediterranean sea. >> arthel: so molly, does this mean that military action is more likely? >> one former ambassador said he wouldn't be surprised if president obama eventually orders some type of military action, but does not think it will be the first response. >> secretary hagel has indicated he's moving assets into the region to give the president option. we saw exactly the same pattern six months ago and nothing happened. i think the most likely response from the lawyer who is in the white house will be to talk about indicting the assad regime and the international criminal court. that's their legalistic response to many things. i think that will have zero effect. >> the united nations disarmament chief arrived in syria today to press the syrian government to allow that u.n. investigative team to go to thesite of the reported chemical attack. arthel? >> arthel: molly henneberg, thank you very much for that report. >> gregg: again, this week's attack is not the first report of chemical weapons used in syria. you recall back on march 19, syrian state media accused rebels of killing 31 people with rockets containing chemical materials. the rebels blamed the attack on the army. less than a week later, an activist network said two people died in an attack involving chemical weapons. april 13, at least three people killed, internet videos of the victims appearing to show symptoms consistent with exposure to nerve gas. a few weeks later, eyewitnesses said canisters containing poisonous gas dropped from a helicopter. eight people injured. one died. >> arthel: we're hearing from former vice president dick cheney as he's weighing in on some of the major scandals now plaguing washington. he says some cases like theirs's targeting of conservative groups are more flagrant than others. >> i plead with people, don't conflate with the irs. those are totally different problems, totally different issues. i believe there is ample evidence that the irs has indeed abused its power, that the power and authority of the irs has been used and misused to go after the opponents of the administration. no question in my mind. and it's in my mind, it ought to be -- we ought to investigate it, subpoena whoever we have to subpoena, bring them to trial and make certain that we build in the kind of safeguards that can't be used again. but it would be a terrible mistake if, because the irs has been abused by barak obama and his people, we would therefore turn and say well, we're going to get rid of the nsa program because it might be abused bythis president. but there aren't any really good examples out there of how the nsa program has been abused. >> arthel: mr. cheney made these remarks while headlining the steam boat institute freedom conference last night in colorado. >> gregg: fox news alert now, hundreds of square miles in flames out west. only getting worse. it's called the rim fire crossing into america's jewel. yosemite national park, so big, it's even threatening san francisco's electricity. meanwhile, idaho got a little relief from the rain, but lightning sparking new blazes. dominic diany fallin the northern -- dinatale. how is it threatening san francisco? >> quite extraordinary that it is, but what's happened is the wildfire moved into yosemite park and there it's threatening the water supply to san francisco because that's where the city gets about 85% of itswater from. as the fire traveled through the area, it threatens the pipelines. it's not just the water supply, it's also the power supply, gregg. you've got power lines that goes through there. the city is saying -- or rather the governor is saying, look, we've taken some of those lines offline and what we're going to do is take power from elsewhere on the grid to power the city in case we do lose the supply. this is covering a massive area. yet 150 miles away. total acreage we lost so far is 125,000-acres, turning out to be the 16th biggest fire california ever had and moment by moment, hour by hour, the acreage increases. that's going to turn out to be one of the biggest fires we've ever had. one of the biggest problems has been the weather. that's what is firefighters are struggling with. the winds keep picking up. >> gregg: it's incredibly fast fire. how much has it consumed just today?>> we've actually had the same acreage. but what the problem has been is that you have these interior islands that haven't been and fire crews have been trying to put those out. so you have the same acreage for the time being, though. the winds are going to change, you and know what? once they get faster than 10, it spreads quickly. what's that will happen in the next 12 hours or so. the winds could reach on the top of the ridges more than 40 miles per hour. that is a big risk and firefighters are saying it's definitely going to be a battle. take a listen. >> right now we're looking at a fire front, about six, seven miles wide just on this division of the fire. we're looking at fires along that line, not only againing the homes, but fighting the fire as it comes. really mother nature at its worst coming toward these firefighters. >> mother nature at its worst, which is why they bought an additional 2,000 firefighters today alone. a total of 4500 professionals battling the flames. they've got to protect the townwhere we are. they think it will come extraordinarily close. at one point, 2 1/2 miles away. the wind will shift and send it back in this direction and they are doing all they can to make sure no houses or property is lost and people stay safe. back to you. >> gregg: dominic, take care. thanks. >> arthel: gregg, police in spokane, washington arresting a suspect in the death of a world war ii veteran. investigators say the 16-year-old is one of two teens who killed 88-year-old delbert belton. surveillance video shows the suspects beating mr. beltton death in a parking lot. the teen is now being held on charges of first-degree murder and robbery. the other suspect is still on the loose. many outraged by this horrific attack. >> he didn't deserve this. it's so senseless. and unnecessary.not for 50 bucks. >> we're not going to tolerate that type of behavior from 16-year-olds or anyone else in this community. >> arthel: hundreds of people holding a candiesle light vigil in honor of mr. belton. he was shot in the leg during a battle in okinawa. >> gregg: update on a very disturbing story we told you about. folks in the oklahoma town where a 22-year-old christopher lane was fatally gunned down while jogging. they're holding a vigil in his memory. police say one of the teenage suspects told them they killed lane out of boredom. some have suggested his race was a factor. prosecutors said friday the evidence does not support that theory. oklahoma governor marry fallon and d.a. jason hicks are chris wall ace's guests tomorrow. check your local listings. >> arthel: fox news alert. good news on a story we have been following very closely.the parents of ten-year-old sarah american began saying she is officially off oxygen and breathing on her own. she is the cyst cystic fibrosis patient. her parents had to go to court to fight to get her an adult lung transplant. the day her parents posting on facebook that they are, quote, enjoying the sunshine outside with sarah. >> gregg: good story. all right. hundreds of dolphins suddenly washing up on the shores in the east coast. what caused this mysterious system of death?

i mean, what's he going to do next, give away stock in solyndra? >> listen, gregg, you can't make this up. government throwing more good money after bad, only the government can come up with a plan to spend $40 million to get $30,000 away. if you have to convince people that this is the greatest thingin their health care decision, something is wrong with obamacare three years after the fact. the american people by a strong majority now believe regardless of party, that they don't trust the cost of obamacare or the care of obamacare. don't take my word for it. the president has already given a pass to big business. they don't have to comply for a year. unions are against this now after they spent over $100 million to implement it. it doesn't work. it will never work. >> gregg: waiver, caveats, delays, they go on. chuck, speaker boehner's spoof here says 7 million will lose their coverage. it's actually happening. 60,000 people in california are getting their cancellation notices. in other states, we're talking about tens of thousands getting canceled. see you later. many spouses, ups, for example, are going to get kicked off their coverage. so much for the president's promise you'll get to keep yourcoverage. >> well, there were 44 million people that needed health care. we passed a law through both houses of government. we had a president sign it and we had a supreme court who upheld it. it's the law of the land. it's a big arduous program. i'll remind everybody we had these same arguments over social security years ago. it's not going to be all perfect. it's not going to have every bell and whistle, but it's a path in the right direction. >> gregg: chuck, you're right in a way, except for when you consider what the president promised. take a listen. >> we do have a long-term problem that has to do with our health care programs, medicare and medicaid. the good news is that in part because the affordable care act, obamacare, costs had actually gone down -- the health care inflation has gone down to the slowest rate that we've seen in a long time. >> gregg: chuck, did you notice he stumbled? here is why: the head did shein florida, state official statements, 35% increase. ohio, 41. indiana, 71. the list goes on and on. should the president promise something he can't deliver? >> yeah. but like i said, it's a large program and it's going to help a lot of americans. i could speak just from myself. my son is 22 years old. if not for the affordable health care act, he wouldn't have insurance right now. my mother has preexistingens. when you ask the american public about parts of it, they're very supportive. >> gregg: brad, here is the thing, chuck's son cannot do anything. i mean, he can pay 95 bucks in a penalty and then he can wait until he gets hit by a truck and god forbid that ever happens and we hope it never does, or gets sick, and then the next day he signs up and he's totally covered. i mean, it's a scam. >> it is a scam. the people are getting scammed the most are the young people.the young people now are being forced to support a plan they can't afford and they don't need. 30% unemployment amongst youth 18 to 30. the fact is, the best way to help the youth of america is give them a job. don't give them something they can't use and then make them pay a penalty for it. as you correctly pointed out, it's better for them to pay the penalty than get -- less -- >> gregg: chuck, you mentioned your son who is young. so here is what happens to young people. look at the screen here. under obamacare, age 25, california males, san francisco, 62% more. portland, oregon, 72% more. in missouri, 89% more. indiana, 91% more. nevada, 101% more. chuck, i mean, your son is just going to get screwed. >> well, what would happen inthe old system is that he would go to the doctor. he'd go to the hospital. he would have the insurance. they would have to treat him 'cause he was at the hospital. his father, who has insurance would go there because he didn't pay. they put his deal on to my bill and i end up paying anyway. if we have more people in the pool and we spread the risk, it will cost the taxpayers less money. >> gregg: you know, here is the other thing. municipalities, brad, and cities, as well as ups and other companies, they're now laying off workers. they're putting full time workers into part-time jobs to beat the obamacare minimum. doesn't that stunt economic growth? >> there is no question about it. again, look at what the unions have said. afl-cio said you're going to destroy the 40-hour workweek. nome is it going to destroy full-time employment because as you point out, those businesses are going to cut hours, make people part-time employees, but the quality of the care they've been bargaining for in share insurance policies is going toevaporate. so the unions who supported this president the most made obamacare the reality it is today are the ones now seeking a carve out from it or a repeal of it. >> gregg: all right. >> the fact of the matter is, it cannot work. >> gregg: thank you both very much. thank you. >> arthel: mystery happening. a growing number of dolphins found dead in the mid-atlantic region this summer. more than 250 dolphins deaths have been reported last month. brian live in our new york city news room with details. what's happening? >> hi. it's really not just the how. it's the why that has the scientists really just shaken up. more than 250 bottlenosed dolphins have been found dead, washing along the shore along the eastern seaboard. now scientists believe it's actually a virus that's causing it. it's already the largest dolphin dieoff since 1987 when more than 740 animals died and scientists expect the number of deaths torise. scenes like this are becoming an all too familiar sight. shocking beach goers down to virginia. >> normally they just swim up and down close to the shore. but all of a sudden, we just started seeing them on the beach all up and down the beach. they're dying on the beaches like that. something is very wrong. something is very wrong. i hope they find out soon. >> in july and august, 253 dead dolphins washed along the coast. 64 in new jersey. and 25 in new york. scientists performing autopsies on the dead dolphins believe a virus may be to blame. it's similar to the measles in humans. take a listen. >> dolphins are very cohesive groups of animals. they're very social with each other within their groups that they travel in. and so a lot of diseases probably pass between each other through that close contact.>> scientists say if you see an animal on the beach, remain at a safe distance away. there are no cases of the virus transmit to go humans, but marine mammals carry a lot of different diseases. so be careful. >> arthel: you just hate to see the dolphins dying like that. >> a sad scene. >> arthel: it is. brian, thank you very much. >> gregg: after weeks of bloody protests, unrest appears to be waning now in egypt. the government there is now trying to take steps to return life to normal. >> arthel: then we switch gears. summer is nearly over, but there is still time to relax outdoors with a nice glass of vino. >> gregg: oh, really? >> arthel: really. >> gregg: really? >> arthel: uh-huh.

kyle harrington joins us, founder and managing partner of harrington capital management. look, kyle, unemployment still incredibly high. the official numbers are artificial because they're worse. so many people have just given up. they're not even counted. >> you're correct, gregg. first of all, let me start with it's disheartening, this marketplace of the 11.8 million americans that are unemployed, 4.3 million of those are what's defined as long-term unemployed, which is calculated with six months or more of not having a job. so that's 36% of the people are long-term unemployed. that's one. two, you are correct, gregg,that the calculation -- if calculated properly, and we do do this. there are people that calculate the unemployment rate with what's called a u 6 statistic, which includes those that are part-time employed and as well those that have given up looking for a job. they have fallen off the unemployment role, so they're no longer able to collect, yet they still don't have a job. when you put all of that and include all of that in the calculation, you will find that the unemployment rate is more close to 14 or 15% in the united states. so disheartening i think is the right word. >> gregg: all right. 35% approve of the president's handling of the economy. 62% disapprove. he has lost, kyle, seven points in just the last several months. two months really. look at this, a fox poll findsthat 71% think his recent economic speeches are just more of the same old thing, devoid of any new ideas. fair point? >> very fair point. i think the narrative has become blase, gregg. now we're talking about a five-year time frame which you can build some momentum over that time. if you look at the unemployment rate, which we've discussed and i've discussed on fox historically, we still seem to see a very languishing month to month job market with a lot of part-time jobs, or a lot of jobs that are $20 an hour or less. so our gdp growth remains very sluggish and in an effort to get this economy going, i think that there needs to be things done that seem to be not being done by the overall administration. so i think that those -- the poll numbers are starting to indicate the boredom.>> gregg: kyle, i looked it up. our brain room gave me the evidence. 21 new or higher taxes since president obama took office. economic growth, abysmal. below 2%. should be 5 or 6% now in a recovery, shouldn't it? >> oh, absolutely. you know, one of the things that is near and dear to my heart is as an entrepreneur, employing someone, i take very seriously. and it's pleasurable to do that. but you have to have the right laws and regulations and compliance in place and not be overly invasive in the entrepreneur's life with higher health care costs and higher bureaucracy. otherwise what happens is the money goes under the mattress and you kind of go deer in the headlights and don't hire new people or don't take the risk with your own capital to bring in new help to grow business. gdp growth remains sluggish. the employment marketplace is what it is. i think the numbers are starting to show the boredom associatedwith the narrative that barak obama and his administration are talking about. >> gregg: not working. july, 58% of the jobs created, low wage industries. that speaks volumes. kyle harrington, good to see you. thanks so much. >> thank you for the time. >> arthel: all righty. check this one out, gregg. pay close attention. fox files takes you inside the octagon with the women warriors of the ufc. look at this clip. i'm up close and personal with rowdy rhonda rousey. if you know ufc, you know she's a superstar. one of the fastest growing sports. check it out. >> go and try as many judo players as they want to train for me, but they won't find anything like them. >> plus files sat town with one of the most dominating women fighters and current 135-pound weight champions, rowdy rhonda rousey. she holds a record of 7-0 withall wins coming by arm bar in the first round. >> i'm entirely emotionless when i walk? >> she's one of the most fierce competitors that i've ever met in my life, ever in boxing or mixed martial-arts. >> arthel: i hope you can tune in for more. it's on fox files happening tomorrow night, 9 eastern on the fox news channel. >> gregg: do you love it so much that you're getting into the octagon? >> arthel: i'm thinking about it. >> gregg: oh, really? i want to be there when that happens. i'm thinking that's not going to happen. >> arthel: i have to unfortunately tell you some shocking news from someone i know personally. it's about linda ronstadt. we have details on the devastating disease the music legend says took her singing voice away. >> gregg: we'll have that and fort hood shooter nidal hasan, one step closer to the death penalty. families of the victims say theyare far from satisfied. susan estridge will be here to weigh in on the sentencing for the convicted mass murderer hey linda! what are you guys doing?

thedoor. here's the news live at the pentagon. are we getting a straight answer how this happened? reporter: well, in essence, someone finally noticed that after reporting to congress last year that attacks by the taliban were down by 7%, a figure derived from month-to-month reports from the field about the number of enemy attacks, in fact u.s. and nato officials didn't include the figures gathered by the afghans themselves, leading to the following statements promenade meteorologist. >> violence levels had been trending downward in the last two years after five years of steady increases, beginning in 2006. reporter: the problem is the attacks weren't trending downward. they were exactly the same as 2011. an embarrassing admission by the pentagon about how the president's strategy was bearing fruit, may have been misleading. >> shepard: what is the pentagon saying now?>> day blame the afghans. the afghan commanders forgot to submit their field reports so the pentagon data was misleading. quote: during a quality control check we became aware that some data was incorrectly entered into the database that is used for tracking security-related incident across afghanistan. >> a regrettable error in our database system that was discovered during a routine quality check. we're making the appropriate adjustments. in spite of the theater adjustments, our assessment for the fundamentalled of progress in afghanistan remains positive. >> nato has taken down the misleading figures from their web site and are revicing them. there's no work inthey -- >>

>> yes. >> shepard: the prosecutor also blasted that jodi arroyos for her habit of snooping on her now dead ex-boyfriend reside phone and e-mail accounts. adam housely is live. this prosecutor has been described around there as a bulldog but jodi is not backingdown at all today. >> no, she is not. they've been battling all day long. at times very contentious, arguing over the meaning of words and how she said certain things, getting away from the actual facts of the case, before the it has been a battle of a match of wits. she judge called both attorneys up there. it goes back and forth all day long. twice she has defiantly said she is not guilty of first degree murder. we got that out of testimony today. let me give you a snippet what it's like as the two battle in the courtroom. >> you can't even remember what you just said. >> i think i'm more focused on your posture and tone and anger so it's hard to process the question. >> so the answer is, it's the prosecutor's fault because you perceive him to be angry. >> it's not your fault. >> irsomebody asks you whose fault is it? >> you did. >> you can see frustration or the prosecution.you feel like you're watching abbott and costello and you miss the facts of the trial. >> shepard: a lot of talk about past boyfriends back to the 1990s. what that about? reporter: they're trying to show she has always snapped in her boyfriends'le background, going through cell phones and e-mail accounts, remembering passwords, to show this is a woman who always had problems, ooh lied and was suspicious all along and they'll use that to say that's what she did to travis alexander, and when she found out what she didn't want to hear, she killed him. that's what they're trying to show with his testimony. >> shepard: helps to break down the case, jonas is here. covered a lot of trials in the past 30 years. never seen anything like this? >> no, i'm sow surprised she is on the stand. there's two -- >> shepard: for the 12th day. >> and probably not the last. the defense has a strategy here. it's first we have to explain why she lied because it's obvious she did. then we have to get the jury tobuy whether those lies are plausible. the prosecution's strategy is get the jury to believe she could not tell the truth, and everytime her lips are moving she is lying, because they, the prosecution, has the physicalled to become up their claim of premeditated murder. 27 stab wounds is not self-defense, shep, not on a good day. that's rage. >> shepard: there's no specific, this number of stab wounds is self-defense, but 27, the prosecution is probably trying to successful argue, is before the number. >> plus we don't even know -- part of her defense is that she shot him -- grabbed the gun out of his closet and shot him in the head. there's no evidence that he actually owned a gun. then she dragged his already-dead body all over his apartment before she ended up stabbing him 27 times. this guy, this decedent, was a target. her battered women's syndrome defense doesn't work because shegot in the car and drove six hours to his house. you don't do that unless you're targeting somebody. they weren't living under the same roof. she wasn't afraid she would get kicked out. she drove to him. he was a target. >> shepard: she claims reason she did this lying is that she was ashamed she had killed him. >> does that make sense to any reasonable mind? you're sitting in that jury box. does that make sense? if she were ashamed she would throw herself on the mercy over court -- she called the cops and tried to lie her way out of it, and sent his grandmother flowers. come on. >> shepard: and a whole long 12-page letter or longer about how he died, which was a lie. >> right. >> shepard: i found this interesting, arias testified throughout the trial about her lovers' supposed double life. a devout mormon virgin on the surface but a sexual deviant, abusive, control freak, underunder the surface. >> no evidence to support he was a pedophile, which is another one of her claims. he was her parttime boyfriend. he was probably using her for sex. why she couldn't find somebody between california and arizona to fill that void, i don't know. my theory is he was targeted because she is a pathological liar and first degree murderer. >> shepard: the diplomats responsible for negotiating with iran say they're optimistic the latest round of talks will be productive. that's what they say. what will actually happen is anybody's guess. the definition of productive?

>> well, several times today bp's chief counsel, mike brock, objected to an awful lot of the statements and the questions that have been made by the plaintiff's attorneys. although most of those were overruled by the judge, and just before the court broke for lunch this afternoon, bp did begin itscross-examination of the master of disaster. suggesting the plaintiffs' witness was suffering from selection bias, accusing him of only analyzing evidence being spoon-fed to him by the prosecution. brock also spent a great tome of time highlighting steps that bp took to step up safety, noting even some awards it had won for doing so. much of the time also pointing to its fellow defendants, transocean and halliburton, saying they made crucial mistakes as well, shep. >> shepard: casey seeing until new orleans, thank you. let's bring in our legal panel right now, rich roth and jeffrey shapiro. the tough job of defending bp, also the man on the screen right, and i don't know where you begin. they'll evidence seems to indicate it knew what it was doing and did it anyway. >> well, first of all, you know,i would differentiate kiss this -- this case from the tip cal cass where manufacturers have a product and i know is defective and figure it's cheaper to pay the lawsuits from the defects rather than fix the problem, but bp was faced with an all or nothing situation. even if they wanted to cut corners or didn't want to do all the safety protocol that could have possibly been done, it's hard to believe they were willing to give it up and let the whole thing literally blow up and face the certainty of millions, billions of dollars of damages. >> shepard: they've added a lot of products sense then. continue to get leases and make profits in the billions. >> that's in hindsight. they made $26 billion in profits in 2011. not revenues, profits. as far as the rig goes, they call it the well from hell is what they're calling it. the captain of the vessel did not know how to operate emergency proceeders.a week before hand it was chaotic, an hour before hand the two people who are supposed to read the monitors misread. so the gross negligence, and a high may be the method. there's so much wrongdoing by bp, over and over and over and over again, and the alarm system, which i find troubling, the alarm system was disconnected, unplugged, it's a wonder the employees could sleep at night. it's like page smoke detector down. >> after it happened and the oil was flowing out, there's evidence to suggest they knew how much was flowing out and lied about it. i don't if you it's jodi arias but it's up there. >> what is this trial about. >> negligence or gross negligence. >> exactly. here's the definition of gross negligence. conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care which is likelyto cause great injury. so that means they consciously and voluntarily didn't use the reasonable care so these rigs would blow up and -- by he way, wasn't just bp, these aren't four guys on the corner. this is bp, hall burt tan, transocean, all of these groups together who are component parts. at it hand to believe that any any of the other people in this mix saw something that was so grossly mentality, they didn't have some responsibility to step forward -- >> in the ncaa they might call at it lack of institutional control. >> the problem is if you have two people whose job is to read the monitors and understand, and they misread it an hour before it blows up, and you have a captain who is hired -- not explained how the emergency procedures work on the rig. at it more than negligence. i can go on and on and on. the safety procedures were not followed. they weren't adhered to they were never looked at. and it is unbelievable this wellfrom hell resulted in unfortunately the most mass sis dollars in the gulf. >> shepard: out of time. any chance this will go through trial?

what was the chatter there? >> well, there are a number of things that were different. safety procedures were different. but one thing to be aware of, these balloons don't all lan in the same place.so we didn't see the balloon land but when we got off, the balloon they wanted us out of the area immediately. the balloon landed right below and forward and emergency vehicles arrived as we got the terrible news about the 19 people that were killed. >> shepard: a mighty tough thing to be along the ride for. michael, thank you for being here. appreciate it. >> my pleasure. >> shepard: 21 years ago today that terrorists -- 20 years ago today that terrorist tried for the first time devow the world trade center. they failed but killed six people in the attempt. next, remembering those six. this is kevin. to prove to you that aleve is the better choice for him, he's agreed to give it up. that's today?

[bell ringing] >> and perhaps, shep, the most moving moment of all is when the relatives of those victims read the names of all 0 those who died that day. listen again. >> don digeovany, robert kirkpatrick, and my father, steven knapp. my father, william ako, will fredo mercado, monica rodriguez-smith and her unborn child. >> a lot of tears here today. shep, as there are every year, of course, on this day. >> and jonathan it's my underring you spoke with one of the relatives today. >> yeah. i spoke to michael mato, who youjust saw there reading out some of the names. i talked to him about the moment that the he realized he lost his father at the hands of terrorists. >> just unbelievable. pre9/11, things like that didn't happen. you dad didn't get up, go to work, and sit in his lunch room, and be killed by terrorists at the world trade center. that was just so unfathomable. reporter: i talked to him two about 20 years on, forgiving, and obviously never forgetting. said, forgetting, obviously impossible but he looked me in the eye as well and choked up and said, forgiving, too is simply very, very hard. shep? >> shepard: jonathan hunt. thanks very much. well, the government created crisis nope as the sequester is set to begin in just three days. that is when the deep budgetcuts that republicans and democrats agreed to months ago will begin to take effect, unless they can reach a last-minute deal. but it's washington, ed henry is outside the white house they've can't do anything, can they? reporter: well, still, paralysis. the president going on the road trying to take his case to the american people. he is in virginia, newport news, where they make nuclear attack submarines and he was warning the region in the commonwealth of virginia they will take major hit and tens of thousands of jobs that will be furloughed and he said congress should find better ways to cut spending. >> these cuts are wrong. they're not smart. they're not fair. they're a self-inflicted wound that doesn't have to happen. reporter: now, he also called out republican speaker john boehner by name and noted inprevious discussions about the budget, the speaker had mutt new cash revenues on the table, and the president criticized for taking those off the table. speaker boehner did not take long to respond. >> so for 16 months the president has been traveling all over the country, holding rallies, instead of sitting down with senate leaders in order to try to forge an agreement over there in order to move the bill. we have moved the bill in the house twice. we should not have to move a third bill before the senate gets off their ass and begins to do something. reporter: a lot of similar rhetoric we heard before. no deal in sight but in the next few moments wore expecting two powerful republicans here at the white house, john mccain and lindsey graham. the white house originally suggested this is a meeting about immigration reform and it is. we're also told by the senators and white house they might get into sequester and other issues.it's significant because the president has not had a meeting in weeks with either speaker boehner or mitch mcconnell. maybe these two republicans will take a message back to the republican leaders and maybe the'll move forward. >> shepard: holding your breath is dangerous. >> it sure is,. >> shepard: one of the most colorful players in nba history is taking his game where no basketball star has gone before. north korea. so what is dennis rodman doing in there? and will he be looking at things? oh this is lame, investors could lose tens of thousands of dollars on their 401(k) to hidden fees. is that what you're looking for, like a hidden fee in your giant mom bag? maybe i have them... oh that's right i don't because i rolled my account over to e-trade where... woah. okay... they don't have hidden fees... hey fern. the junkrawer? why would they... is that my gerbil? you said he moved to a tiny farm.that's it, i'm running away. no, no you can't come!

greta is next to go on the record. greta, take it away. >> greta: this is a fox news alert. five-year-old child is still being held in an underground bunker held in unbelievable 54 hours after a gunman grabbed him from a school bus and shot his bus driver to death. jonathan serrie has the latest. is there any indication that this man is going to release this child? >> reporter: no indication yet. hostage negotiations now going into a third night. it's entirely possible we could be here sometime longer. nearby residents living near the suspect have told authorities this underground bunker is well stocked with food and water and that the suspect has been known to stay in there for as long aseight days at a time. the mainline of communication between hostage negotiators and the suspect remains a four-inch in diameter pvc pipe leading to the bunker behind the mobile home of the suspect that neighbors have identified as 65-year-old jimmy lee dikes. the five-year-old boy appears to be physically unharmed but emotionally upset. >> we know he is crying for his mother and his grandparents. why the shooter does not release this young boy to his family is hard for me to understand. >> reporter: now, residents say jimmy lee dikes has displayed a violent temper threatening neighbors with a gun and fatally beating a dog with a lead pipe after the pet ventured too close to the property. in general, he seemed to beparanoid. listen. >> does not believe in any form of government. he believes that government is the enemy. that everything a conspiracy. >> and then we want to tell you about charles polling, jr., 66-year-old bus driver who lost his life while reportedly trying to protect the children on board his school bus when the suspect came on board the bus with a gun. funeral services for him are scheduled for sunday. >> greta: jonathan, is the man in the bunker, has he made some sort of knantdz that we know? has he said, look, i'll release this child if... has he said anything at all? >> reporter: it's possible that he has, but if he has police are not saying anything about it. they have been very tight-lipped about the hostage negotiations,one possible concern is there is a tv down in that bunker so whatever is reported in the media he could be able to see. police being very cautious about what if any information they are releasing. >> greta: jonathan, thank you. a school bus is full of children when the gunman stormed on board. they watched the gunman as he shot the bus driver to death. good evening, sir. >> good evening. >> greta: can you tell us what the children saw? what did they tell you they saw? >> when they stopped the school bus to allow one of the children to get out, the shooter had stepped aboard the bus and asked they release two children between the ages of 6 and 8 years old under him. he told some of the kids to get off the bus. i don't know at the time if all were released or some of them.they also said that the bus driver had stood up between him and some of the children to try to protect them. that the particular time is when he was shot. >> greta: i'm curious if they gave any indication that the gunman seemed to know the bus driver or whether pick out some child to take or whether it was random. any indication either way? >> it seems like it was a random kidnapping. we do know that the driver and the shooter did have knowledge of one another and had actually words in the past. >> greta: this is rather small community. have you ever heard this man or hear anything about him? >> i have not. i've only been back in the community about 7 months. i pastored a church for five years but i did not know him or anything about him previous tothis incident. >> greta: i can't imagine what that family is going through. have you talked to the family at all? >> not directly but i talked some people who have had contact with them. of course, they are wanting to say low profile and want to respect their privacy. the families say they are doing as well that can be expected. i know that they have had some ministry and people taking care of them. >> greta: thank you, sir. we're expecting new information from police at a news conference within the hour. stay right where you are. we'll bring you the news as soon as we get it. to capitol hill where sparks are flying. a fierce fight for defense nominee chuck hagel battling critics from his own party. >> were you correct or incorrect when you said that the surge would be the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam?were you correct or incorrect, yes or no? >> my reference to this -- >> the question is, were you right or wrong? that is straightforward question. i would like you to answer right or wrong and then you are free to elaborate. >> i'm not going to give you a yes or no answer. >> let the record show he refuses to answer the question. >> i'm a supporter of israel. i said in some cases i am a strong supporter of israel. i think it's in my book we have a special relationship with israel. >> name one person who has intimidated by the israeli lobby in the united states senate. >> first. >> name one. >> i don't know. >> why would you say it. >> i didn't have in mind a specific person. >> do you agree that it's aprovocative statement, that i can't think of a more provocative thing to say about the relationship between united states and israel and the senate and congress in which you said.... >> you continued to hotel extreme views far to the left of even this administration. >> do you think it is right that israel was committing a sickening slaughter as you said before on the floor of the senate. >> i think i would read all of what i said. first i've said many times every nation has a right to defend itself. >> do you think a slaughter would constitute a war crime? >> no, it depends if they were attacked. it depends on many things. >> the question i would like to ask you and you can answer it, what do you think the iranian foreign ministry strongly supports your nomination to be secretary of defense?>> i have a difficult time with american politics. senator, i have no idea. thank you. >> greta: john bolton joins us, ambassador, at the hearing today senator hagel is a republican. he got grilled by fellow republicans, didn't he? >> it wasn't so much the questions although they were stiff as the answers. this was a debacle for chuck hagel today. if his nomination is defeated, we'll look back and say this was the place where it went down in flames. not only was he not able to defend many of his earlier statements, but he demonstrated a lack of command over the subject matter that he would be responsible for if confirmed. he couldn't identify what the obama administration's policy was. i think one of the telling exchanges changes when he first said that he supportedcontaining a nuclear iran. someone hands him and a note and reads the note, i guess i misspoke. we don't have a policy on containing a nuclear iran and senator levin has to tell him, we do have a policy. we're not in favor of containment. we want to prevent iran from getting a nuclear weapon in the first place. the senator hagel can't even get that right, i think it really left his supporters on that committee very shaken about the case they now have to make. >> greta: he seemed woefully ill prepared. it was he was anti-israel and made the statement in the 12 years as senator, he never voted against israel at all. the way he answered the questions, he seemed woefully ill prepared. he was always on defense. >> i think he came into thehearing with a lot of liabilities. he left with a couple more. the first is the competence question, whether really he is able to address the issues he is going to have to take under his wing as secretary of defense. he didn't seem to have an idea that the budget cuts that are about to fall on the defense department came from the sequestration in the budget deal. he said several times in the hearing he sits on top of the defense department. a lot of people work for him and he'll be a leader and responsible, but he didn't seem to understand what the job of secretary of defense entailed. i think there is a competence issue. there is also a character issue with n washington what is known as confirmation conversion where confronted with statement after statement he made before, he said i didn't quite appointee it. maybe i misspoke. i would put it a different way.it really was very weak performance. i think it has to be troubling to the administration as they look ahead to the coming vote. >> greta: is there a difference in qualification for the job of secretary of state versus secretary of defense. in recent years, with so many wars going on and so much overlap, i'm curious how you compare and contrast those qualifications? >> think the job of secretary of defense necessarily involves a lot more management and planning issues, the long term development of weapon systems, planning strategic allocation of resources where the secretary of state job is much more of a policy job. the fact is both are large and important positions. we're about to have or we may have two secretaries who haveminimal executive branch experience. when you add a president and vice president that have minimal executive experience, i'm worried about the strength of our policy in a variety of areas but particularly in national security. >> greta: i don't think i recall seeing a cabinet nominee that looked so bruised at the end of the day with the questioning. >> i think there is some unhappy people in washington. one happy person i think of. two unhappy people are cluck hagel but chuck schumer who started out on this nomination, i want to wait until the hearing then the white house put the heat on him and he endorsed hagel. my choice for the happiest person, hillary clinton that she didn't have to go before this committee to ask questions about benghazi. >> greta: thank you, sir. we want to know what you think. should former senator hagel bethe next defense secretary? go to our website and tell us. and americans are seeing unemployment benefits up. what does president obama do? he lays off his jobs council. the president decides not to renew the jobs council. >> out the door, president obama closing a chapter on the jobs council. >> this is an illustration of why the president probably should never have assembled the panel. >> it was not as shovel ready as we expected. >> the economy is tanking. >> remember the shovel-ready jobs that weren't shovel ready. >> shovel ready was not as shovel ready as we expected. >> we have had four years of the obama economy. it hasn't worked. >> it's been tanking for four years. >> the worst the jobs council did was very helpful. >> the jobs council that didn'tembrace the president's jobs program is when you have to say, what are they up to. >> jobs council -- >> a number of ideas was acted on by this administration. as part of the president's overall commitment to job creation and economic growth. >> shovel ready was not as ready as shovel ready as we expected. >> as it turns out he had a whole bunch of business people that were trying to be good enough to get a food goodies from the president. >> you are more concerned with meetings than progress. >> there haven't been the recovery. now, we have the fourth quarter where the economy shrank. it contracted. >> greta: now what? ron johnson joins us, republican senator. i may be one of the few that it's not a big deal because i thought it was a silly photo op, to put these people in and wepretend something happened. >> it was window dressing. >> greta: i don't know what the accomplishment, four times in the first year and zero in the second. >> they came up with a report. they made some recommendations, pretty good recommendations, increasing investment in the private sector, to make sure that america has abundant and affordable energy. reduce the regulatory burden. these are solid proposals. >> greta: how do you do it? >> they are contrary to what president obama wants to do. affordable energy, president obama said as a candidate what we need to do because his cap and trade policies, electricity rates would skyrocket. his energy secretary, we need gasoline prices to the level of europe. so what his jobs council was proposing runs contrary what president obama's ideology. if you are going to make america attractive for business expansion you don't increase taxes. you don't continue with this$1.75 trillion regulatory burden on our economy. that is number that largest in the world. that is what we burden our businesses with each and every year. president obama has done nothing but increase the regulatory burden. >> greta: i like politicians reach out to people with particular expertise to solve problems. but to form committees to look good and this one did not seem active committee. if it was active it didn't do well because the economy shrunk in the last quarter. where do we stand now? what are we going to do about jobs? >> we have to get our fiscal house in order. there are so many things creating a lack of confidence. it starts with getting the federal government fiscal house in order. >> greta: i know you voted no, but they extended credit card for the federal government. are we really doing anything to get our fiscal business inorder? >> it starts out with flushing out a plan, a real viable plan from president obama. how about having the senate pass a budget which they haven't done in four years. one good things in terms of the house suspending the debt limit, giving the democrats time to pass a budget so we have something to compromise with. why don't you guys get along. i'm happy to work with anybody that to acknowledge the problem, but it's hard to compromise when you don't even have a viable plan. the last two budgets voted on three times. >> greta: i lay the blame on harry reid. house had a budget, maybe good or but the senator never let it be brought to the floor so give and take negotiations. however, where i casted the blame back at president obama he submitted the budget is why didn't he pick up the phone andtell his party leader, harry reid, get a budget so we can at least have a conversation. >> listen, these are such important issues. i hate these back room deals. we voted on the fiscal cliff at 1:40 in the morning on new year's day. >> greta: who read it? >> i prevented 99% of americans from getting an income tax increase and money flowing out of the private sector to the inefficient government sector. i knew the basic thrust of doing business. we should have regular order which would be the house passes a budget, senate passes a budget and you reconcile that and that is the framework for the committee work. >> like the president was supposed to submit a budget. there is no regard for deadline. if the rest of us in americaignored deadlines. if i showed up at 10:15, how long would i keep my job. >> america is bankrupt. only reason we're not functionally bankrupt we can print money. do you know what your share of the federal debt is? $52,000. we have blown by greece in terms of per capita debt. >> greta: we some could pay it off now and buy out now? >> good luck trying to borrow the money under dodd-frank. >> it's not just the superbowl. competing head coaches, john and jim harbaugh. one person to be on edge is the father jack harbaugh. what does he have to say about the big match-up. also a new twist, in the dispeerngs after an american woman in turkey. police, a huge star is joiningthe ranks of john edwards and arnold schwarzenegger. which one admitted to having a love child. that is coming up.we're all having such a great year in the gulf, we've dided to put aside our rivalry. 'cause all our states are great. and now is when the gulf gets even bett. the beaches and waters couldn't be more beautil. take a boat ride or just lay in the sun. enjoy the wildlife and natural beauty. and don't forget our amazing seafood. soome to the gulf, you'll have a great time. especially in alabama. you mean mississippi. that's florida.say louisiana or there's no dessert. brought to you by bp and all of us who ca the gulf home.>>. >> greta: ravens versus 49ers at sunday, it will be brother versus brother. competing coaches john and jim harbaugh. how is the parents going to handle it? we spoke with the coaches' father. >> what is it for you and your wife? >> we're still trying to feel our way through it. it hasn't hit us what impact this has on our family and what impact it has on us. just the stage is so big andwe're still trying to find out what our place is. we had come to the conclusion. less you see of jack and jackie harbaugh the better the world would be. it's about the 106 football players that are going to compete. two great coaching staffs that are going to be competing against each other. you have a team on west coast and team on east coast, great coaching staff, great men, humble men competing in this great sport. great, great pride, but, jim, it's no different when they came home and they said, dad, i made our junior high school football team. that smile on their face. you hugged them. i'm so proud of you. dad, i'm the starting whatever on high school basketball team. the emotions you feel aren't any difference but the stage is bigger and there is more people to share it with.as a parent the emotions are all the aim. >> how are you going to be handling the different emotions at the end of the game. one will be hoisting the trophy and be champion for life, the other son will be back in the locker room with a went wrong with this opportunity? >> we had a blueprint. we saw last year on thanksgiving when they played the game. i know the stage is bigger but for us, you have the same emotions. high emotions. i think our first thought will be, for that came up a little short. agony of defeat we've all heard since we were very young. we'll take time to go and share the thrill of victory with the other son. with equal emotions. >> greta: he joins us with the home of superbowl number 47. did the father of the twocoaches mention where he would be watching the game and where his wife watching the game. are they in new orleans and are they back home? >> they will be in new orleans. they will be in stadium and will be watching. jack par har but a says his wife gets animated during the game. a lot of times she will from time to time scream. so she will be screaming at the game. it will be a difficult day for them because you will want to cheer on one hand one team, but feel bad on the other hand. it's a very unique situation. we haven't seen anything like this in sports other than when the william sisters played in grand slam championships. >> greta: i can't decide whether it's parents to have a huge blowout for one of the two teams or have a cliff-hanger where its heartbreak. i can't decide. which would you prefer? >> the mother has petitionedroger guedell and asked for a tie. he has not gotten a response from the commissioner. i would think that maybe some of the strain would be taken off if it is a blowout. country won't want that. country wants to see a close game. >> greta: last time they met was thanksgiving 2011 was raiv convenience victory? >> yes, it was. >> greta: have the teams changed dramatically since then? >> yes, they have. they changed dramatically during this season. both of the head coaches, their father was a coach for 40 years in high school and college. he knows what tough decisions are. john harbaugh fired his defensive coordinator toward the end of the season. since that time, joe and rave convenience has done well. alex smith the starting quarterback had a concussion and got replaced by kaepernick. when smith got well he decided to stay with kaepernick who hasbeen nothing short of sensational. both of those moves took a lot of guts and turned out to be proven very right. >> greta: and you also mentioned what their father said vince lombardi trophy, the green bay packers that won against kansas city chiefs. you remember that one? >> of course, he won the second one as well. >> greta: he won the second one, as well. who is favored this weekend? >> the odds makers in las vegas are saying that the 49ers are 3 1/2 point favorites. down here you get a feeling on the streets there seem to be here on thursday and some 72 hours away from the game, right now it seems like it's being overrun by the people at baltimore it's much closer. >> greta: 49ers, the pass he made against denver, think itwas 70 yards in the air. that sets a tough one for the quarterback for the 49ers to run. it will be a good game. >> should be fun. >> greta: thanks very much. of course you can listen to jim's coverage of the superbowl on dial global radio network. who are you rooted go for john harbaugh or jim harbaugh? go to gretawire.com and tell us. up next, it's no secret. many small businesses are fearing the cost of obamacare will on force them to lay off workers. one business owner says he has a secret to outsmarting obamacare. he is here to tell you what it is. also, it's happened again. a married celebrity joined the list with a love child. who is it?

>> reporter: not a whole lot. looks like more of the same. we're in a holding pattern information wise. they are trying to be tight as possible with information for obvious reasons.they don't want to jeopardize the negotiations. >> greta: do you know what kind of information the gunman can see in the buncher via his television set. is there anything they can do are or are trying to do? >> i'm not exactly aware of that. that is my understanding. >> tell me about this gunman. >> he has believe it or not an extensive criminal history. he has a couple prior arrests. he was arrested in florida for a firearm charge. he displayed in a menacing manner and he was arrested before menacing one of his neighbors. he approached one of them with a gun and arrested and brought up on charges. he was scheduled for a courtappearance on window. >> what i don't understand, misdemeanor charge. if you menace someone with a gun it could be assault with attempt to kill which is very serious felony. menacing a neighbor appears to be the charge and why he is out on the bond? >> that appears to be the case. a lot of people are involved in the situation and we probably will more. it is a misdemeanor charge. that is one of the questions that a lot of neighbors have had so far is how, with a kind of warning signs were in place from the get-go. >> greta: i would like to hear from the prosecutor why this guy was out misdemeanor brandishing a gun and menacing someone. anyway, greg, thank you.we're staying on top of the breaking news. now, to obamacare. small businesses are bracing for it. many business owners across the nation fearing obamacare will give them no choice, but to lay off workers. one business owner says he has figured out a way to outsmart obamacare. paul christensen joins us. nice to see you. >> good to be with you. >> greta: one of the thresholds that the business people are facing if you have 50 employees or more, you are going to have provide health insurance. some business owners are trying to get below the 50 which means layoffs. tell me what is your idea or thought to bypass to layoff to get underneath that 50 number. >> my solution is one that was formulated a few years ago by silicon valley thinker called michael malone in a seminal book the future arrived yesterday.his notion was one of something called the protean corporation which is designed primarily to provide fast response to changes in the economy or markets or other conditions. so that their business can be as efficient as possible. as i was thinking about the problems that businesses are having with obamacare and this 50 number, instead of laying off employees or moving into part time or some extreme cases shutting down the business, i thought that the protean concept of basically moving all but a core group of people that are responsible for the essence of the corporation, what the products are, how it messages, those kinds of things, was a real solution. so, i basically postulated howbusinesses can convert employees to their own corporation as a way of getting out from under this obamacare. >> greta: you have a 75 employees and you are worried you want to get under the 50. all 75 in theory could go out and pay $30 and become incorporated and you don't have 75 employees but contracts with individual corporations. so you have 75 different corporations and then you would get out from underneath that. is that the thinking? >> that is essentially thinking, but what would probably happen, some of those people would get together and form a little bit larger corporations, to kind of share overhead costs. the important thing is, we got into this nest back in world war ii when companies were trying to pay their people more, but couldn't because of wage and price controls.to work around that was to provide health insurance as a way to artificially raise the overall compensation. that has continued. now, we have obamacare as yet more government kind of meddling in the economy and businesses are going to need to be creative in devising strategies for dealing with that. >> greta: or lay off or pay the health insurance and ree dues the profit. anyway, we're going to see a lot of work around this. thank you, sir.   coming up, a very strange disappearance. search for the american woman that vanished in turkey. brand-new turn. in two minutes, you know longer have to wait for the superbowl to see the ads. one company now regret releasing the ad early. the commercial is coming under heavy fire. you'll see the entire ad foryourself and decide two minutes away. dysfunction - you know,that could be a question of blood flow. cialis tadalafil for daily use helps you be ready anytime the moment's right. you can be more confident in your ability to be ready. and the same cialis is the only daily ed tablet approved to treat ed and symptoms of bph, like needingo go frequently or urgently. tell your doctor about all your medical conditions and medications, and ask if your heart is healthy enough for sexual activity. do not take cialis if you take nitrates for chest pain, as this may cause an unsafe drop in blood pressure. do not drink alcohol in excess with cialis. side effects may include headache, upset stomach, delayed backache or muscle ache. to avoid long-term injury, seek immediate medical help for an erection lasting more than four hours. if you have any sudden decrease or loss in hearing or vision, or if you have any allergic reactions such as rash, hives, swelling of the lips, tongue or throat, or difficulty breathing or swallowing, stop taking cialis and get medical help right away. ask your doctor about cialis for daily use and a 30-tablet free trial.[ male announcer ] to hold a patent that has changed the modern world... would define you as an innovator. to hold more than one patent of this caliber... would define you as a true leader. ♪ to hold over 80,000... well, that would make you... the creators of the 2013 mercedes-benz e-class... quite possibly the most advanced luxury sedan ever. see your authorized mercedes-benz dealer for exceptional offers through mercedes-benz financial services. for exceptional offers all stations come over to mithis is for real this time. step seven point two one two. rify and lock. command is locked. five seconds. three, two, one. standing by for capture. the most innovative software on the planet... dragon is captured. is connecting today's leading companies to places beyond it. siemens. answers.>>. >> greta: new superbowl ad is sparking controversy. take a look. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ >> greta: groups are calling the ad racist and object to the use of an arab man using a camel and ad asks viewers who vote to win the coke bottle. tell us what you think at gretawire.com. back in two minutes. humans. even when we cross our t's and dot our i's, we still run into problems. namely, other humans. which is why at liberty mutual insurance, auto policies come with new car replacement and accident forgiveness if you qualify. see what else comes standard at libertymutual.com. liberty mutual insurance. responsibility. what's your policy?

security checkpoints at airports. tsa is removing those body scanners, all 174 full body scanners. they are ending the contract with the company that makes them. peter doocy has the latest from washington. >> tsa pulled the maker of those scanning machines that took revealing photos to fix their software so flyers looked more like cartoons this the photos, but that company couldn't do it. it says congressman dated back in june that all scanning machines need the targetrecognition or technology that produces the more vague images. tsa by june 1st travelers will only see machines that have atr that allow for faster tlu put, faster lanes for the traveler. they paid them $40 million for their machines and rapid scan has to take them out at their own expense. >> fourth amendment says you can't be searched or seized or person can't be accepted without a warrant. what they are doing is pulling back here is making something that is in line with the fourth amendment and not in violation of people's rights. >> the khair man of the house committee john mica he didn't even know the if the controversial machines worked. >> there is a lot of hard earned tax money going for unfortunately theater security. >> reporter: they are still going to useful body scanners that create generic images butthey point out that travelers can opt out of the body scan with a pat down if they prefer. >> heather: you are really disappointed. >> gregg: it's my only attempt at exhibitionism, little joys in life. all right. >> heather: pricy body scanners that gregg loves is request matter of questionable government spending as president obama prepares for his second term has a lot of work ahead of him to cut wasteful spending and bring the debt under control. a new fox poll finds more than eight out of ten americans believe government spending is out of control. so what can we expect to see in the next four years. let's written bri in jamie whining o weinstein. so eight out of ten americans say we spend too much but up from 2010, 62% from 2009,regardless people think we spend too much. if you break that apart further, almost all republicans and independents and two-thirds of democrats they all agree, government spending is out of control. we are at the beginning of a second term. where do we go from here. >> clearly i think it's a good sign that american people is recognizing spending is out of control but what do they want to cut? when you get down to the nuts and bombs of that, don't touch medicare or social security, but if you don't touch some of the popular programs you won't be able to cut spending in the long run. the question is, yes, cut spending is good, but what programs are they willing to cut and modify. >> heather: and let's take a closer look at two polls specifically regarding the debt ceiling. this is the question we posed. is reduce the federal deficit a worthy goal?this is interesting you may recall white house press secretary made news by stating that deficit reduction is, quote not a worthy goal onto itself. 77% of voters disagree with them and that includes large majorities of republicans, independents and democrats. what is your take on this? >> again i don't want to be a downer here, the question is what urgency to do they place on that. we had an election two months ago where there were two candidates, one was more focused on cutting the deficit and reducing our long term debt and one didn't think it was a big concern. the one who didn't think it was a big concern won the election. yes, voters seem to say that is an issue they agree with, but when it came to election day two months ago that certainly wasn't one of the top issues they voted on because they voted for the candidate who wasn't embody go it. >> heather: through his actions, as well. that leads to this, how f or ifit should be raised? should the debt limit be raised again, 23% say yes, but 69% don't agree with the president. they say raise it only after major cuts. there again what cuts would those be but president obama as we know he increased the debt by $6 trillion in his if you are four years. some say that administration overspent by one trillion a year every year since he's been in office. now she demanding the get ceiling to be increased again. do you think he will be listen to the 69% that say only after major cuts? >> he already said he doesn't think anything should be tied to the debt ceiling. it's something you shouldn't play with the full faith and credit of the united states. what is interesting about this, coming out of the republican retreat that just occurred, there are some republicanswithin the republican house, republican caucus who actually agree with him on the sense that you don't play with the debt ceiling as the point to which to make cuts. there are other issues coming up like the continuing resolution and sequester cuts where they would like to make their last stand there for cutting getting spending cuts and allow on temporary extension without not much attached to it. >> heather: let's talk about the economy. the president starts his new term. less than 1% rate it as excellent. 9% say it's good shape. that is up a touch from his first inauguration but 91% of voters say economic conditions negatively today. why are we here again? >> you have to wonder. i point you back to november the conditions haven't changed all that much in two months. i would imagine that those exact numbers were the same on election day, and the americanpeople not only re-elected the president but gave us the same senate in the house as we had before. so as much as they are saying economy isn't going well, when they had an opportunity to change things they voted for more of the same. >> heather: you mentioned congress, finally two polls dealing with that. first since president obama was re-elected, 30% think he has been more bipartisan in working with congressional republicans, 55% the majority says he has been more confrontational? >> i think some of the number for confrontational they are saying that as a positive. certainly democrats want him to be more confrontational before his reelection. some of that is positive element according to the people that saw it that way. i think that is interesting that they see it as confrontational. i'm sure there is a mix of positive and negative.>> heather: finally, not surprising, voters remain unhappy with the congress overall. 76% disapprove of the job they are doing and the record low approval for congress was 10% by the way back in august of 2011. here is the thing, dissatisfaction with congress is so high that two to one, everyday americans should do a better job in handling the country's problem. jamie, could you do a better job? >> i know it's a difficult job, but here is the thing with that poll number. when you ask americans generally and you have seen this in other polls, is congress doing a bad job and everyday americans could do better. what about my congressman? it's the other guy that is the problem. once again i point you back to november where they had a house election in each district and basically they elected more or less the same house. a lot of people re-elected back so when while they see otherpeople are doing bad job their own congressman they see as doing pretty good. >> heather: we begin another four years. thank you very much. we appreciate it. >> gregg: coming up, we have a jam packed newscast including advocates for gun rights holding rallies nationwide. we'll tell you about the latest push to protect the second amendment. >> heather: plus new concerns for vital source of income for millions of americans. is the standoff over the debt ceiling threatening social security. >> gregg: lance armstrong showing a sign you rarely see from him. why emotions were running hard in the second part of his interview with oprah winfrey.>>. >> judith: welcome back. at least 14 people are dead as floodwaters rise in indonesia capital of jakarta. this is desperate operation as the city braces for more monsoon rain. david has more from bangkok, thailand. >> reporter: yes, indonesian capital remains on high alert for more flooding. it has been raining. death toll has been rising.we have 14 confirmed dead and also there has been some intense rainfall over the past week. it did come to a head back on wednesday. local authorities were forced to release water from the main river into canal because they were afraid it would break its banks. it poured into the city including the presidential palace. despite the move the river flooded the central business district causing chaos there. emergency crews backed up by special forces after working around the clock to try to fix the breach in the canal. teams are also trying to rebuild the dike which breached and allowed the river water to enter the city center. police and military had to use rubber boats to evacuate people from there and also bring supplies to other areas. trains also ground to a halt as railways and stations were inundated. electricity had to be cut off from large parts of the city because of the danger. it's estimated about third of the city of 14 million peoplewere affected at the height of the flooding. officials say over 15,000 people had to take refuge at emergency evacuation centers. jakarta to s prone to flooding as it sits on low lying land and is close to the sea, but the problem has increased over the past decade as the city has expanded and the infrastructure hasn't kept up with it. also, they are predicting over the next 24 hours perhaps two foot of rain dumping on jakarta. they also say the forecast that more monsoon rains are heading that way. >> heather: thank you very much, david. >> gregg: lance armstrong appearing to get very emotional during the second part of his interview with oprah winfrey in which he admitted to using performance enhancing drugs throughout his cycling career. he broke down when talking aboutthe impact of the scandal and especially on his 13-year-old son, luke.   i told luke, i said... i said don't defend me anymore. >> gregg: about the only time he got emotional through the entire two shows, an hour each. there is a whole lot more. when oprah asked him if he agreed to do the interview because he wanted to get back to compete. >> if you are asking me do i want to compete again? the answer is hell, yes, i'm acompetitor. it's what i have done my whole life. >> gregg: he had drawn criticism for the first part of the interview saying he was not contrite enough. public reaction to these two nights have been absolutely scathing toward him. i wrote down a few of them. you surf the nets and find articles and reaction. self-serving, manipulator trying to dictate the narrative. here is another set, still lying still evasive, protecting people rationalize go and lacking humility. >> heather: i watched the first part. i decided not to watch the second part. >> gregg: because you didn't like it. >> heather: i didn't want to watch. >> gregg: he struck you as a guy that he got caught. >> heather: i kept hearing everyone was doing it. >> gregg: rationalization. >> heather: as an attorney you would advise him do that. >> gregg: he could be charged with criminally with drug trafficking as well as moneylaundering and perjury that he never doped. many more chapters to be written on lance armstrong. >> heather: coming up, secretary of state hillary clinton will soon testify before congress on the deadly terror attack in benghazi. it is now four months after the attack and so far no one has been brought to justice. what can we expect her to say about the situation. >> gregg: gun owners across the country are standing up for their second amendment rules taking part in gun appreciation day to protest president obama's plans to control firearms. will the newer rules work? will they have any impact? a fair and balanced debate is coming up.

americans are deeply skeptical. a scant 22% tougher laws can help. stop shootings like in newtown. 71% say no way, people will find way to commit unspeakable crimes. time for a fair and balanced debate. coalition of stopping the violence. omar, you saw that a huge majority of americans and 71% think tougher laws will not stop tragedies like newtown but they do think just the opposite. more guns in the hands of lawabiding citizens would actually work. take a look at this poll and we'll put it up on the screen. nearly twice as many people think there would be less violent crime if more people owned guns than if guns were banned. is the president going at this the wrong way? >> not at all. the president is going the exact right way. he has comprehensive approach and he is focusing on background checks. we aren't saying we can prevent every single murder in this country. when my sister was killed at virginia tech on april 16th we learned that the gunman passed two background checks. his name was not in the background check database. if it was he would have been prevented from buying those guns. 40% of all guns in held in this country and what the president is proposing is to close that loophole and that is great first step. >> gregg: people like that idea. john, let me go to you -- let mecome to you another fox news poll. found enormous support for what omar is saying, other ways to reduce gun violence, helpings the mentally ill and enforce the existing gun laws, mental health checks. are these measures reasonable. would they make a difference? >> i don't think they would. a lot of the numbers that were just given are simply wrong. 40%.... >> gregg: they are not wrong. it's a polling of sentiment of american people. >> i'm not saying the polls are wrong but the numbers that were given out about background checks were wrong. that 40% of sales don't go through background checks is simply wrong. >> that is not wrong, they do. >> no --. >> gregg: john, finish, go ahead. >> from a survey done in 93 and 94 done by the clintonadministration, if you look at the numbers, almost all that 40% are inherit and within families or gifts within families. if you remove inherit as an and gifts within families it drops it down to near 10%. there are other biases in the survey, too, but it's really a wrong number. >> that is ridiculous. >> gregg: it works better if i ask the questions. >> i would like to respond to that. >> gregg: respond to my questions if you would. most crime infested cities have the most restricted gun laws. i'll give the example, chicago the toughest gun laws in america they have done almost nothing to deter rampant gun violence there. doesn't that ge nate the argument for greater gun control? >> it doesn't negate the argument. a year after i experienced what the private sale or gun show loophole. i bought ten guns at richmondgun show completely unchecked. we of allowing dangerous individuals to find loopholes and they are finding their way on the second market on dangerous individual. if we want to curb gun violence we need a federal law to make sure that all states are closing the loophole. if you do that i think you'll see a difference in this high crime rate. >> there is a a lot of studies that have been done, brady act on state background check and i don't know of a single study that has found this reduced crime. there is a simple reason for that. almost all the stops that they have, temporary checks that they have involve law abiding citizens, false positives. when the president said there were 1.5 million people who were stopped from buying guns, it was wrong because 99.8% of those arefalse positives. let me give you an example. >> gregg: i want to get to one more point. i'll leave that for omar. as you know the president is promoting a ban on assault weapons but the last one lasted ten years and it was studied at grades length. the national research council institute have justice they all studied it and concluded the ban had no impact on gun violence, indeed, when it expired murder and gun violence went down. doesn't that tell us that banning assault weapons will not make us safer and maybe make us less safe? >> first of all, you are failing to talk about the fact that the nra gutted all the most of laws. they dismantled any type of law that we've had. they can changed the law so they could continue during the ban to make assault weapons by making stylistic changes to the guns.what we need.... >> they said crime would go up. >> no matter what guns, listen, no matter what guns are out there, we have huge loopholes that are allowing dangerous people and you have seen that assault, military assault style weapons are the choice. >> gregg: we have to leave it at that. we are completely out of time. i make you this promise, john and omar, you know the subject matter. this is not a debate going away. we would like to invite you back and we'll do that. >> happy to come back. >> gregg: thanks so much. >> heather: coming up, after a series of delays, secretary of state hillary clinton is set to testify on the deadly terror attack in libya. what can we expect to learn when she goes before congress. >> gregg: looming debt ceiling battle raising concerns that entitlement programs like social security could be in jeopardy. we will take a look at the risk to millions of americans next. in blind taste tests, even ragu users chose prego.prego?! but i've bought ragu for years.

because of this social security could be on the chopping block and that would leave about 55 million recipients with less money for living expenses, joining us is gary is a fox news contributor. thank you for joining us. we're talking about 55 million social security recipients. is it at risk? >> let me put their fears to rest. not one dime is going to be missed. these politicians love their power and one mistake they would make is one dime come out of those checks. keep in mind, our government takes in $200 billion a month. social security is one-quarter of that. medicare and medicaid is quarterof that. there is plenty of money coming in regardless of what happened to the debt ceiling. >> many recipients rely on their monthly checks to make ends meet and economy benefits from them spending money. there would be a trickle down effect and the treasury department would only have enough funding to cover 60% of the country's financial obligations. some think something has to give and something has to be done if the government is forced to pick and choose, what would save social security from being targeted? >> first off they would prioritize and the elderly and social security they care about. they would be the first ones that will be taken care of as far as the medicare and medicaid. that is why i'm not worried about that. in the past when it happened in 1996, they took treasury took special steps to ensure things got paid out until things got done. i'm a big believer there is enough fed up americans rightnow, and these politicians realize they are getting more fed up something will get them sooner than later, just like the fiscal cliff. >> heather: you mentioned what happened in the mid 1990s, congress gave the treasury authority to issue enough to cover social security payments for the month of march. an estimated $61 billion is due between february 15 and march 15. what about delayed payments or partial payments? >> again, i think that the politicians -- by the way, i hate the politicking of this and the constant making everybody worry. i think it does get done. if it doesn't it may be a few days after that. it would be the worst thing possible to have any person getting social security all of a sudden have to worry about it. the economy is not just aboutspending but how they feel about spending and government. if government takes too long to get this done, it will affect the economy that is just trying to get off the back here. i think they will get this done. i'm not as worried as other people are and i'm definitely not worried about social security. >> heather: no worries, be happy. gary, thank you for joining us. >> gregg: you should write a song like that. >> heather: i think i've heard it before. >> gregg: days from now

secretary clinton said we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice those responsible for killing u.s. ambassador christopher stevens and three other americans and that was four months ago and nothing has happened. so what can we expect to hear before she appears before congress? steven yates is former assistantto dick cheney, good to see you. four months have gone by, nobody has been brought to justice and no retaliatory action has been taken. weekly standard wrote a column on it. jihadists in the region emboldened by lack of response to the attacks 6 taken to taunting the american investigators and celebrating u.s. feebleness. weekly standard goes on to argue that the u.s. is being humiliated. are they right? >> i think they are more right than we care to admit. a lot of time has passed and a lot of questions this important hearing should address. i have relatively low expectations given the state department has foreshadowed the approach to these questions with the independent reported they commissioned that looked at decisions. why the false narrative? why were journalists and others able to pick through a crime scene before the f.b.i. coulddebate goat on seen and the administration has little or nothing to say about the rise of islamics and rise of arab spring. >> gregg: one of the leading suspects, when you read the weekly standard piece is sitting in lobby of a luxury hotel sipping a strawberry fratee bragging i don't need to fear the united states. it gets worse than that. the tunisians are holding another main suspect but reportedly our government didn't do nothing to gain access to him and then he was let go. is it your spence sense that president obama and his administration may not care enough to do something about these murders on 9/11? >> my primary concern they have no plan. if they have a plan, they really need to re-look at metrics of how it is working. we have large aid donors who aremore willing to accommodate the terrorists than our demands for justice. we have basically the move of al-qaeda's base from afghanistan to 5,000 miles closer to the united states across northern africa and on europe's doorstep is profoundly important strategic change and the administration has nothing to say about it. that is deeply troubling. >> gregg: what do you expect, if anything, that is meaningful, that is, from hillary clinton or will it be subterfuge. >> she learned the art of the filibuster. there will be some long questions and maybe some long responses. i hope that we get some sense for why did the state department have realtime information that went against what the administration had to say for weeks after this profound event.why have we run into these difficulties with the investigation? what needs to change in american diplomacy and deliver on her promise on bringing these people to justice. >> gregg: would she be in a position to tell the committee and tell americans what was going on the night of the attack and who turned down the requests for a rescue for aid for some kind of assistance? i mean those people were begging for seven hours for help and it didn't come. do you think she would be able to address that? >> i think she is in a position to know the answer to those questions. there are lawyers on different ends of pennsylvania avenue where executive privilege applies and doesn't apply. were whether the additions zigsz were made in the white house and whether someone in the state department can speak to them. if she wasn't on the scene with answers to these things, why wasn't she?that was her job and if it wasn't hers, she could point to principal deputy that should be able to answer. >> gregg: i can hear it now, national security interests, executive privilege. steven, we'll have you back to talk about it. >> heather: still to come, new developments in the hostage situation in algeria, freed hostages and still others are unaccounted for. the latest coming up in a live report.>> gregg: hello, i'm gregg jarrett. welcome to a brand-new hour inside america's news headquarters. >> heather: topping the news this hour, the tsa will pull body scanners from more than 170 airports across the country. the decision coming after numerous complaints into security machines create revealing images of airport travelers. >> gregg: days after president obama proposes sweeping new gun control measures, americans are speaking out about gun control and the second amendment. we'll have the brand-new rasmussen polls just ahead. >> heather: plus, do you think the flu season is nearly over? well, health officials agree with you, gregg. they say this year's deadly outbreak has not reached its peak yet. first, we begin with this. fox news alert and breakingdevelopments in the hostage crisis in algeria. the government there claiming that its special forces ended the stand-off in a bloody siege of bp's natural gas plant. the details of the operation and the number of people killed still remain unclear. we do know that at least one american is dead and at a news conference today, leon panetta confirmed that there were american hostages held before the siege. greg palkot is live with the very latest from london with this developing story. >> we are getting a little bit more clarity about the operation and the death toll. still there are questions, including the fate of americans. again, over the past couple of days, the algerian special forces moved in on the armed al-qaeda linked militants holding the hostages at that energy facility in algeria. according to government officials just in the past couple of hours, they haveexplained that final assault on the militants today. they said that, in fact, there were dead on both sides, both on the militants and the hostages. and the latest provisional death toll for the entire four-day siege, 32 militants dead, as well as 23 hostages and that includes foreign hostages. as for the americans, state department, we were talking to them a short while ago, they are still not coming up with numbers, except for the acknowledgment of the one american who died of a heart attack during this siege. we have been reporting that we believe that five americans had escaped and were free. we also had been saying, however, that two americans were still being held by the militants. reuters news agency today saying that they felt that two americans were freed today. but we have not gotten that confirmed. here is a little bit more of what secretary of defense leonpanetta had to say in london today. >> we cannot accept attacks against our citizens in our interests abroad. neither can we accept an al-qaeda safe haven anywhere in the world. >> panetta refused to criticize the algerian security forces. some have said they were too heavy handed in their mission against the militants holding the hostages. at this very melt we're told they continue to mop up that energy facility. it had been booby trapped with mines and explosives by the militants and heather, yes, the grim death toll grows, or the fear of those deaths, anyway. the u.k., norway, and japan are now saying that 20 of their citizens are unaccounted for andfeared dead. and we're waiting on word from the u.s. officials. back to you. >> heather: greg palkot live for us. we'll have much more on this coming up with a former c.i.a. operative who has participated in numerous operations in algeria. so stay tuned for that. gregg? >> gregg: and the first lady kicking off the inaugural weekend with a national day of service, doing their part at an elementary school in washington as thousands of folks are joining the first family, taking part in volunteer projects across the country. molly henneberg is following this live in washington. what did the president do for national day of service? >> hi. you spoke a little bit about it. he and the first lady and their two daughters went to an elementary school in washington and joined hundreds of volunteers there in a school makeover project. the president and first lady helped out by staining a book shelf. the president praised those with try to help out their communities. >> there is a huge hunger on the part of young people to getinvolved and to get engaged and it was interesting, we were talking to one of the young people, i was staining a shelf and i did -- michelle says i did a fine job. >> vice president joe biden also took part in the national day of service. he and his family went to the dc armory and stuffed care packages for deployed soldiers. gregg? >> gregg: there was a large scale service effort on the national mall, i believe. what was that all about? >> a big tented event on the mall. numerous organizations set up booths allowing people to get involved in service projects right there. including projects to fill backpacks with books for children in need and to create a mural for a dc area school and many more. there was some star power in attendance, too, including a former first daughter, and a hollywood actress. >> renewing america's promise. we're going to give back to ourschools and students and we're going to search our community. and i am deeply grateful to the inspiring example of my grandmother and my parents and i am so grateful to see so much enthusiasm in this room today. >> also speaking today, delaware attorney general and son of the vice president, beau biden. >> gregg: thanks very much. by the way, be sure to stick with fox news channel for a complete inaugural coverage. tomorrow we'll have the official swearing in for president obama and tune in monday at 11:00 a.m. eastern for inauguration 2013 anchored by brett brett and megyn kelly. >> heather: nationwide show of support for the second amendment. gun rights advocates are rallying all across the country for what's being called gun appreciation day. demonstrating their support for gun ownership while sending a strong message to washington, just two days before presidentobama's second inauguration. catherine herridge is joining us live from a gun store in virginia. what are you hearing from gun owners? >> thank you and good afternoon. this is the first time all day that we've had somest and quiet and we've seen parking spaces in the parking lot here at the gun range. it's really been a capacity crowd today and what we've heard for the most part is that people came out to say they really support what they say is the sanctity of the second amendment and others say they would support change to the legislation to raise the age for gun ownership, while others believe the obama administration is targeting the wrong people. >> i don't think it addressed anything close to what the real problem is. trying to outlaw certain guns because they're black guns and hold large rounds of ammunition isn't going to do anything to stop those monsters. >> critics say gun appreciation day has shown a certain amountof tone deafness or insensitivity coming so close to martin luther king day, and of course, coming in the shadow of the newtown shootings. >> heather: i watched your reports throughout the day. you've been out there since early this morning. every single hit, it sounded busy. what too we know about gun sales? >> what we have on gun sales is really very anecdotal. what was strike not guilty reporting here is that they say that in the last two to four weeks, they have been selling out of everything. so high caliber, small caliber, and then also hunting weapons as well. so it's been virtually everything. they also said they've had a lot of first-time gun owners. while people won't say it was specifically proposals to restrict gun ownership that had driven these sales, it seemed pretty clear people had a high degree of motivation. we also spoke today with one of the organizers for gun appreciation day and he said that he would stand his ground against the critics.>> this is a reaction to the left reaction to newtown. so the idea that they would use and exploit that tragedy to push their legislation is what i find owe financessive. >> -- did she offensive. >> one of the most striking conversations was a gun owner who said let's put the second amendment and gun rights aside. his objection was as he described it, tinkering with basic american rights and constitutional rights in this country. heather. >> heather: catherine herridge live from warrenton, virginia for us. thank you very much. >> gregg: as the debate over gun control intensifies, the president of the national rifle association is saying that he is actually received hundreds of death threats. he says he has always been a high profile target for folks who want tougher gun control laws in the country, but the threats had increased in the weeks since the mass shootings at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut. during an interview this week ona radio talk show, he says even his kids are receiving threats. >> i've gotten dozens, hundreds of death threats. my son who has the same name as i do, had somebody post a death threat on his facebook page and when he and my daughter came back, i don't know how do you all this 'cause i'm not a computer geek, came back and said, actually this isn't him, but he is our dad and we think he's a pretty good dad. they came back and said, now that we know you're their children, we wish you'd be killed because then he'd feel bad. >> gregg: keane blames the threats on the president's quote, attempt to demonize those who disagree with them for everything he doesn't like. >> heather: gregg, the new york newspaper that posted the names and addresses of law-abiding gun permit holders on its web site now apparently backing down. the journal news outraged gun owners publishing the interactive map showing exactlywhere their homes were located. authorities say that some of those houses ended up getting burglarized. the journal took down the map three days after new york's governor andrew cuomo, passed stricter gun control laws, including privacy measures for legal gun owners. >> gregg: big money changing hands right now in the state of as arizona some of the world's most expensive cars hit the auction block. hundreds of thousands of people are there for the bidding. organizers say there is a big number of jump in the number of course up for grabs and it could be a sign that an economic rebound is just around the corner. dominic has more from scottsdale. hi. >> hi there. we're in the middle of furious bidding. pictures you're looking at courtesy of our colleagues at speed tv owned by the parent company of this network. a corvette. 125,000. that's a high price for thiscar. we are seeing record bids coming in which is indicative really of what is happening in the car market. people here are the organizers, particularly saying the amount of bids we're getting, the car price, the amount of money people are prepared to put down, $1 billion on the lot of guaranteed credit lines have been approved, is being viewed and is indicative of not just a bounce back in car sales burks wider economy. this is what one of the organizers said is how it's all coming about, gregg. >> we tend to go down before the slow down, before the economy slows down. we tend to pick up before the economy picks up, 'cause most of my customers are business owners. they've got their finger on the pulse. they know when to pull back and they know when they think there is a good clear runway ahead of them o start spending again. >> some of those business owners expect up to 11% pour year on -- per year on the cars they bag here. that outperforms wall street.some of the cars on sale are actually iconic models. the green hornet, from back in 1968. about 3 to $5 million that model alone. we've got the pierre arrow. probable lea going to 1 to $2 million when it's auctioned off later tonight much and we've got the f-150, ford truck that was owned by former president george w. bush. he used it on his ranch. that will go for about a million. sales so for, 47 million. enough for the main auction where they're expecting really, really iconic cars to be sold off. it could total $100 million in sales in this auction alone, which is why it makes it the world's biggest. a lot of these cars will be sold and the proceeds will be donated to charity. they're hoping they can hit the $50 million mark for that. it's an incredible event. back to you. >> gregg: there are some real beauties you were showing us. take lots of pictures and send them to us. dominic, thanks very much.>> heather: i'm so jealous. take a picture, bid on one and bring it back. >> gregg: i've been to a car show here in new york city, they are so much fun. there are so many things that you wish you had lots of money to buy them. >> heather: i'd take the '67 red corvette. >> gregg: it was a beauty. >> heather: many people dread when they pass through those airport security scanners. gregg actually prefers them. he likes to just stand there for a little bit longer. they can create revealing images of every person who has to pass through them. now the tsa making a major announcement about them. >> gregg: you know, to become president, a candidate must win 270 electoral votes. now some state republicans want to switch up just how certain states divide up the electoral college votes and reaction from democrats is fierce. a fair and balanced debate coming up. >> heather: plus, does this toy water gun look threatening to you? hello, kitty, gregg?>> gregg: i love it. >> heather: it trial got a five-year-old in big trouble. i'll tell you why. >> gregg: seriously? >> i know that they're trying to, i guess, ban down on stuff like that at school, but obviously i don't think bubbles would hurt any child. just get them wet i gave birth to my daughter on may 18th, five days later, i had a massive heart attack. bayer aspirin was the first thing the emts gave me. now, i'm on a bayer aspirin regimen. [ male announcer ] be sure to talk to your doctor before you begin an aspirin regimen. [ woman ] learn from my story.but for most of us it represents something more. it's the time of year that we have all waited for. when we sit on the edge of our seats for four quarters. it represents players reaching a childhood dream. the biggest stage there is in sports. a time when legacies are made. where a magical play can happen every snap, and you remember exactly where you were when it does. watch every moment of super bowl xlvii live on nfl mobile. bringing the big game to you when every play matters... verizon. call star-star nfl to download nfl mobile from verizon.why do more emergency workers everywhere trust duracell? duralock power preserve. locks in power for up to 10 years in storage. now...guaranteed. duracell with duralock. trusted everywhere.>> gregg: welcome back. time for a quick check of the headlines. new plan in congress could avert the latest debt ceiling crisis, at least for now. house republicans expect a vote twoness raise the government spending limit for another three months in hopes of giving lawmakers time to pass a federal budget. >> heather: a priest who suffered severe injuries in last summer's shooting rampage in a milwaukee temple is showing new signs of awareness. he's been largely unresponsive since the attack that claimed the lives of six others. >> gregg: baseball hall of famer earl weaver has died. he managed the baltimore orioles for 17 seasons. the cause of death has not as yet been determined. he was 82 years old. >> heather: those controversial full body scanners at the nation's airports are going away. the tsa removing the x-raymachines after coming under intense pressure by airline passengers who complained that their privacy is being violated. peter doocy reports from washington. >> the tsa told the maker of the scanning machines that took very revealing photos of air travelers to fix their software so flyers looked more like cartoons in those photos instead of naked adults. but that company couldn't do it. and since congressmandated back in june that all scanning machines need the automated target recognition or atr technology that produces the more vague images, the tsa now says by june 1, 2013, travel also only see machines which have atr that allow for faster through put. this means faster lanes for the traveler and enhanced security. the tsa paid the company $40 million for their machines and now they have to take them all out at their own expense. >> the fourth amendment requires you can not be searched orseized. your person cannot be searched without a warrant. obviously the scanner is not a warrant. so what they're doing in pulling back is making something that isn't in line with the fourth amendment and not in violation of people's rights. >> back in march, the then chairman of the house transportation committee, republican congressman john micah, said he didn't even know if the controversial machine worked. >> there is a lot of hard earned taxpayer money going for, unfortunately, theater security. >> the t.d. a is still going to use full body scanners that create generic images of bodies, but the tsa points out that travelers are always opt out of a body scan if they prefer a pat-down. heather? >> heather: peter doocy reporting from washington. thanks. >> gregg: changing the way the president wins the white house. some republicans state lawmakers pitching a plan to change the rules for how the electoral college votes in certain blue states are allocated. the focus move is outragingdemocrat, including the head of michigan's democratic party who calls it, quote, election rigging. let's bring in former republican congressman of ohio and former democratic congressman of pen opinion, joe sestak. gentlemen, both of your respective states, blue states, have republican controlling both houses. so they could make the change and congressman sestak, i looked it up, it does leave it up to the state legislatures to determine the calculation. so why not? >> absolutely. we have to respect that the states can do what they decide to do within their own borders. that said, before they take a step like this, for whatever reason, i think they have oarlock at the whole of the united states. so for example, if one or two states does change it, let's say texas, which has a large electoral votes, now it's gog distribute its votes on how much each candidates get. but right next door nearby is california with 12% of american and they don't change, all of asudden texas' citizens, has the votes change second. what is of great concern is if you have a third party. all of a sudden, if all of the nay states change, you might have 15 rural states where it puts a little money into media, this third party. it gets 20% of the vote in those states. that means it might have six electoral votes and if there is a tie overall t can then bargain like a parliamentary system. bottom line is, we have bad enough jerry mannedderring. if we start messing around with the national, we'll have a bigger problem. >> gregg: what's interesting is i looked at the latest gallup poll that came out a short time ago, a huge majority of americans want to change the electoral college system. 63% versus a scant 29% who want to keep it. what's interesting is more democrats want to change the electoral college, get rid of it. is that because a lot of peoplefeel as though it's outdated. it has outlived its original purpose and it is at base, inherently undemocratic to give the big swing states all this disproportionate influence? >> let me say when the president takes the oath of office tomorrow for the 57th time in our history, making america the continuing record for the longest, oldest government on the planet, i don't think you can overemphasize the significance of that being the electoral college. when our founders put in in order to be president, every president has to carry at least half of the country. and that changes everything. they're going to go for the sixth government in the last 15 years on tuesday in israel. when there was a special election in california a few years ago, 135 people applied because the parties were not involved in that special election. under our system, the electoral college means that whoever takes that oath of office, has carried half of the country and i believe that that is the majoringredient that is what has made our system so successful all of these years. as mentioned, you can change how they're distributed, nebraska and maine say according to whatever congressional district you're carrying. but the electoral college, in my mind, is the single most important part of our national election process. >> gregg: congressman sestak, when you go back and read the federalist papers, the framers talked about their deep concern there was a disadvantage to the smaller, especially the rural states because communications back then were so primitive and transportation was very, very difficult and they felt as though, wait a minute. the candidates can't get their message out. they can't go to some of these rural areas and so let's devise this system to make it more equal. that's not the case anymore, is it? >> well, actually ronald reagan spoke very well about this exact point. he said those who want to do away with the electoral system will disenfranchise our midwestern or rural states.he said that because we are a republic where states' rights and their representation is important and he didn't want the tyranny of the majority. what he wanted to make sure that those states that 15 rural ones could at least get their electoral vote heard because they had, like even though they're rural, at least a decent amount of electoral votes. it's very important -- >> gregg: they can still be heard, if you just do it on a proportionality, like maine and nebraska. right? >> yes, but maine and nebraska, as you know, only have two and three congressional districts. and only one has any not won everything there. when you begin to get into states like texas or pen, then you're beginning as an individual state to jerry mannedder what the outcome can be. then four years from now as democrats control that, then they change it back to the old way and you've lost so much trust in politicians already, you lose trust in the sanctity of the politics. >> gregg: what's wrong with direct popular vote?al gore is an advocate of it. of course, there have been four presidents who have been elected who didn't win the popular vote. george w. bush beat al gore in one of those. >> as you know, regardless of if you're a popular former president like teddy roosevelt or eccentric billionaire, you can not become president unless you carry half of the country because of the electoral college. if you do away with that, let any popular mayer or movie star or baseball successful player, if you let all of those people run for president, you would have a presidential ballot that looked like the manhattan phone book. it's only because of the electoral college that we have a two-party system and if we do away with that or amend it, then our country will take spin that we have never had in our history. >> gregg: joe cess stack, bob, thank you so much. >> thank you. >> heather: coming up, new warnings from the cdc concerningthe flu. how much longer can we expect the u.s. outbreak to last?>> gregg: it is the bottom of the hour. time for the top of the news. the cdc is warning the flu outbreak in the united states may last six more weeks. nine more children have died in the past week alone due to the flu-related illness, bringing the total number of pediatric deaths to 29. >> heather: the woman charged with pushing a man to his death in front of a new york city subway says that she was having a bad day. she says she targeted the indian immigrant because he was hindu. >> gregg: we are awaiting the autopsy results of a poisoned lottery winner from chicago. his body was exhumed yesterday. police want to know exactly how he was poisoned with cyanide.he died in july after winning the lottery. his death was initially ruled a result of natural causes. >> heather: we are following breaking developments out of algeria where we are awaiting new information on the hostage stand-off at a bp natural gas plant in the sahara desert. at least one american is dead and other americans were among the international group of employees taken hostage. all of this started wednesday morning. that's when militants stormed the plant. the attackers initially claiming that it was revenge for france's operation targeting a dangerous wing of al-qaeda in nearby mali that. is where it is fighting to establish a new home base. so what does all of this, what is the group's presence in the region and now this deadly attack against foreigners mean for the u.s. and the international community? joining me now on the phone, former c.i.a. operative, mike baker. thank you for joining us, mike. >> thanks very much. >> heather: algeria just to bring all of our viewers up tospeed, is the birth place of al-qaeda's affiliate in north africa. also known as al-qaeda in the islam okay magreb, or kqim. >> right. >> heather: most of the group leaders and their allies, they are algerian, including the suspected ring leader. this hostage plot, i really want to ask you about him. he's one-eyed desert bandit, he's also known as mr. marlboro and the uncatchable. you yourself have been involved in numerous operations in algeria going back as far as the 1990s. what do you know about the group claiming responsibility first for this attack and taking over the gas facility? >> everything is connected out there. so nothing happens in a bubble. this isn't something that backed up. the fellow you mentioned, he's been around ever since he was a teen-ager in the soviet occupied afghanistan. he's had a stent of jihad there and drifted to various jihadsaround the region, including going back into algeria in the '90s when it was extremely ugly, violent and ruthless war that was waged between the algerian military and muslim extremists, primarily the islam okay arms group. so he's been around. the point is not just himself, but his lieutenants and a variety of other fighters -- that you can trace them back, a lot of them back to the soviet occupied. or consulate. they move from algeria, then to iraq, then back to afghanistan again, then they're in yemen, then in somalia, in libya when gadhafi is overthrown. all those weapons taken out of the armory. then they make their way back in algeria and into mali and own the northern half of mali. >> heather: mike, first of all, we should say it's unclear whether he was working withal-qaeda and islam okay magreb, but what do we though about them specifically beyond what you just said? they sound like they're disbanded, they move around a lot. what threat do they pose to the u.s.? >> a major threat because some of this talk now, pundits are saying, he had a falling out with aqim and started his own group called witnesses and blood and has a couple other names. then he's been out there trying to establish himself. but he's been a major leader in the sahara area for some time of the but whether it's aqim or another extremist group, they're all basically like minded and share a certain agenda. and so we need to be very focused on this and we haven't been because in part, we've been wringing our hands for years now over how to establish a stable society in afghanistan, thinking that that was our only dog in the hunt, that somehow al-qaedaand the extremist movement was some sort of enterprise that if we can create a stable site in afghanistan, then we have our problem solved. but that problem moved into the north africa region years ago. i'm afraid our foreign policy has not kept up. >> heather: and that's what i want to ask you about, the foreign policy. for months, u.s. officials, we have intensively lobbied algeria, whose military is by far the strongest in north africa, i think you would agree. we've lobbied them to intervene in next door mali where the rebels have established this well defended base of operations. why, in your opinion, have they not acted and why did they shun outside help in dealing with this latest hostage crisis? >> because they don't view it in their personal interest. the algerian government and military, they are very efficient. the military is very efficient. they're not subtle, as we've seen from the attack on the facility. we shouldn't be surprised at their aggressive reaction to this. they've been fighting extremistconcerns for decade. but i think what it points out is again, we don't have much leverage there. you're right, we have been lobbying algeria hard to take a lead role in trying to recapture northern mali, but they don't view it that way. they look at their own insurgency in the '90s when hundreds of thousands of laws, i was out there during that i'm and they said, hey, where was the rest of the world? we didn't get any support back then. so i think they're doing what most countries do and what sometimes we apologize for doing ourselves, which is act not guilty what they perceive is their best interest. >> heather: all right. mike, thank you so much tore your insight. we appreciate. you've been there and dealt with this. you know what you're talking about. thank you. >> thank you very much. >> gregg: prosecutors resting their case against the woman accused of murdering her boyfriend, laying out shocking new details about that grisly killing. judge jeanine pirro is here to look at her defense team's latest move. >> heather: a pen opinion girlsuspended from kindergarten for threatening to shoot a friend with this pink water gun. why her school says it made the right move. the school thinks they did and why parents say they disagree. >> gregg: i love hello kitty. don't you power down your little word game. i think your friends will understand. oh no, it's actually my geico app...see? ...i just uh paid my bill. did you really? from the plane? yeah, i can manage my policy, get roadside assistance, pretty much access geico 24/7. sounds a little too good to be true sir. i'll believe that when pigs fly. ok, did she seriously just say that? geico. just click away with our free mobile app.>> heather: welcome back. a five-year-old pennsylvania girl is suspended from kindergarten after she told a classmate that she was going to shoot her with a toy gun. but take a look at this. this is the toy. it is the hello kitty pink water pistol that shoots bubbles. a school official overheard the remark, searched the little girl's backpack, but did not find the hello kitty gun. the school suspended the child for ten days for making a, quote, terroristic threat. later reduced the punishment to two days. the family has hired a lawyer and is fighting the suspension. gregg? >> gregg: can i just say that'sreally stupid? terrorist threat? come on. blowing bubbles. arizona prosecutors have rested their case in a murder trial that has gripped the nation. jody arias is charged with brutally stabbing her ex-boyfriend in 2008. prosecutors say arias also shot him in the head, then took pictures as she dragged his dead body across the floor. now the defense wants the case dismissed. judge jeanine pirro, the host of ""justice"" with judge jeanine. you've entertained motions to dismiss ad nasa yum in your career. it's malpractice for a defense attorney not to make the motion when the prosecution rests. but it's not going to happen. >> i don't think it's going to happen here. what's interesting about this, gregg, i any thank the jurors asked the question of the judge, and i think it had to do with the fact that they wanted to know if the friends of travis alexander, the victim in this case, had an alibi. for them to ask that question solate in the game makes you say, is this another casey anthony? the friends of his, did they have an alibi the night he was killed? it's almost as though they're saying, maybe there might be someone else. >> gregg: they're instructed by you as a judge to keep an open mind. >> and i would instruct them o keep an open mind. but i think to answer your question, it is pro forma, do you it as a matter of course. they haven't proven their case. >> gregg: let's cut to the chase here. when you shoot somebody in the face, stab them 27 times and split their -- slit their throat ear to ear, one can argue this is a crime of deep passion. the question is, is the crime excused under the law of self-defense? >> well, you have to look at the facts and what we have here is a defendant who seems to be diabolical. she says, number one, that she doesn't know anything about it. then she says, well, there weretwo people who threatened her in a mafia style that they would kill her family, but she got away. then she says years later, i did kill him, but it was self-defense, only because there are pictures, by the way, of them having sex minutes before he was killed. and you've got her dragging her leg, her pants dragging him across the floor. >> gregg: here is the thing, you always hear defense attorneys say you know why my client mutilated the body? because she had been abused physically for so long, over so much time that she had all this built up trust separation anger and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it's proof of self-defense. >> here is a clue for everybody out there who thinks that her case may be self-defense. number one, she was stalking him. she hacked into his facebook. she slashed his tires. she was extremely jealous. she heard that he was going to one of the islands with another girl. she was a jealous, possesssive woman.ergo, why does she need to defend herself. by the way, who shoots and stabs and then cuts someone almost -- someone who is involved. >> gregg: or somebody who has been abused for years and years. that will be tough to prove. look, she can't take the witness stand, can she? >> sure, she's a liar. >> gregg: she is a liar and the prosecutor will have her for lunch on cross-examination. >> this is the kind of defendant i would love to get on the stand if i were trying the case. but what you have here is a woman who says there is no way any jury is going to convict me. she is so confident her position, maybe she'll believe that, continue to believe it, take the stand, and then, of course, a prosecution will make mince meat out of her. the only issue i have is number one, did the state prove that it wasn't self-defense, which is their burden. and number two, if she's convicted r they going to give her the death penalty? >> standard jury direction, if you find they lie in one part, you can conclude they lied about everything. >> that's right. >> gregg: she's in trouble. judge, good to see you. >> good to see you.>> gregg: you can catch ""justice"" with judge jeanine at 9:00 p.m. eastern time right here on the fox news channel. check it out. heather? >> heather: still ahead, brand-new developments on the hostage crisis unfolding in algeria. the latest on the four-day old stand-off with islamist extremists and a crucial role involving the u.s. in the siege. >> gregg: and president obama is preparing to take his second oath of office. will you be watching the inauguration? what the polls are telling us that americans will be doing on monday. >> the constitution of the united states. >> preserve what are you doing? nothing. are you stealing our daughter's school supplies and taking them to work? no, i was just looking for my stapler and my... this thing. i save money by using fedex ground and buy my own supplies. that's a great idea. i'm going to go... we got clients in today.[ male announcer ] save on ground shipping at fedex office.>> gregg: get out your party hats, it's party time in the nation's capitol. almost. as president obama prepares for his second inauguration. but people across the country can catch the excitement watching the big moment lit right here on the fox news channel. >> heather: according to some new polls, by rasmussen reports, just 58% of americans plan to watch all, most or some of the inauguration. and that's down from 75% when president obama first took office back in 2008. >> gregg: scott rasmussen is an independent pollster and the president of rasmussen reports.com. good to see you. so do you have a sense as to why there is a fairly significantdropoff? >> sure. look, when i got married, we had lots and lots of people at a big party. our fourth anniversary, my wife and i went out to dinner. second time around, you dewpoint have as big a crowd. >> gregg: i hope it was a really expensive dinner. >> it was. >> gregg: for your sake. >> by the way, it was a big deal for our 25th anniversary. so i want to clarify that. >> gregg: atta boy. >> the point is, it's a everybody different environment, both parties are a little more subdued. republicans are panicky after two bad elections in a roam democrats don't have quite the same enthusiasm. but they're happy to be in their position. much better shape than republicans. >> heather: scott, you mentioned your marriage. four years in, you're still kind of a newly wed. you're still supposed to be excited about what is to come. how do the american people about this? we're headed into the second term for the president. are people optimistic? >> well, they're a little more optimistic than they were fouryears ago. when the president first took office, 27% said the country was heading in the right direction. now it's up to 36%. on the day he was sworn in, four years ago, 35% said their finances were in good shape. it's up to 39% today. so progress, but people aren't really excited yet. there is still a lot of concerns to be dealt with. >> gregg: let's talk about the second amendment. you conducted a poll on that. what did you find? >> 65% of american voters, out of american adults, two out of three, say the reason we have a second amendment is so the people can protect themselves against tyranny. this is something you don't hear a lot about in debate. they talk about hunters or recreational use. the second amendment was there for a reason, coming out of the revolution, and most recognize that view. >> heather: earlier, gregg had a heated debate talking about gun ownership and stricter gun ownership rules and laws. how do people feel about that? >> there are some mixedfeelings, from modest reforms like districter background checks, 86% say absolutely. even to have a three-day waiting period, three out of four say it's a good thing to do. but a majority say it's more important to enforce the laws we have than to create some new ones. i think what you're going to find is there will be some support for limited new measures. but in a nation where six out of ten say they'd rather live in a place where they can defend themselves rather than a gun free zone, you're not going to see much of a change. >> gregg: if you listen to the media these days, you would get the clear impression that the nra is as unpopular as cockroaches and colonoscopy, but that's not true, is it? >> no. 49% of americans do have a favorable opinion of the nra. it's down five points from middle of 2011. so they've suffered a little bit of a loss of prestige here. on any question involving the nra, or guns in general, thereare big differences between suburban, rural and urban areas. and people in cities have a real hard time grasping how deep the roots are for the nra and for really gun ownership as part of the ordinary life in rural america. >> gregg: surely enough. scott rasmussen, thanks for the polling data. always interesting. have a great day. >> heather: cockroaches and colonoscopies. >> gregg: on that happy note, that's going to do it for us. rick and arthel take over top of the hour. >> heather: we'll see you back here tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. eastern. be sure to join us. >> gregg: bye-bye. have a great day. ♪ ♪ [ male announcer ] you don't have to be a golf pro to walk like one.♪ when you walk 10,000 steps a day, it's t same as walking professional golf course. humana. health and well-being partner of the pga tour. to volunteer to help those in need. when a twinge of back pain surprises him. morning starts in high spirits, but there's a growing pain in his lower back. as lin grow longer, his pain continues to linger. but after a long day of helping others, he gets some helpful advice. just two aleve have the strength to keep back pain away all day. today, jason chose aleve. just two pills for all day pain relief. try aleve d for strong, all day long sinus and headache relief."

good why is there suffering. >> why was the trailer blocked from facebook and youtube? . >> ladies and gentlemen, governor mike huckabee. (applause)>> thank you. thank you very much. and welcome to huckabee from the fox news studios in new york city. look, i thought long and hard and was trying to find a way to take a movie that would illustrate the astonishing events in the past week. fail safe with henrow fonda wouldn't work because it was a very serious president who painfully understood the consequences of making mistakes with world power. >> you are responsible for what happens to us. today did we learn from it? >> what did we do mr. chairman? what do we say? >> and i couldn't use air force one about a president who personally fought off a plane full of terrorist to save his family and the world.get off my plane. and all right. no. none of the great films about presidents role or if i canititional. and the way president obama and his team handled the crisis in syria. i had to reach deep in the vault to find a classic movie to work to illustrate the leadership we have seen from the white house. >> it is a live one. and they were considered the clumsiest desparaddos that graced the old west. >> maybe that would fit, okay. >> the president preempted re- runs of here comes honeybooboobecause he wanted to attack syria and he pretended that the bluff tossed out by secretary of state john kerry in london was his master plan and he had discussed weeks earlier with russian president vladimar putin. if you believe that, i was the one who urged president kennedy to boldly declare we would put a man on the moon when i was five years old. and scene from the twilight zone, john kerry saying, if we took military action in syria it would be small. i wished my father held that vow of discipline when i was a kid. i would appreciate small rear blistering instead of the ones iended up getting. my father laid on the stripes and i saw stars. . and if the doctor's strange quality of bungling was not enough. we had this in the new york times by the russian president. i guess the new york times ran out of old commies to write editorian and they enlisted the ref repped putin who preached brother hod and equality by admonishing to get over the heresy of exceptionalism and accept to being med iocre and invoke his holy exoration and closed with these words. >> but when we are all different. we ask the lord blessings and must not forget that god createdus equal. the old kgb commie got a large dose of religion and shares the athiestic foundation of his past to declare the nations are equal and ask the lord's blessings. reverend i am afraid i will not be singing the ha llel uja h chorus. i don't accept all nations as the same. ones that murder their open citizens with gas or bullets and bombs and they call for the a nilation of all jews and christians are not equal for those who attempt to functioned as a nation of laws. forgive me reverend putin. i believe america is a exceptional country and refuse to believe that it is dangerous to believe that. we learned this week, the danger is when we stop believing we are exceptional and have to call on russia to rescue us.>> secretary of state john kerry and foreign mippister la vror had an agreement that syria has to submit the detailed list of chemical stock pile in a week and called for the entire arsenal of chemical weapons to be dedestroyed bite middle of next year. will bashar assad play ball? lindsay graham supported the strike before the deal was made and joins me now. it is great to have you back. appreciate you being here today.

>> absolutely not. it is a blind alley and a box canyon for america. putin led us down a road where there is no good out come. without the threat of force the agreement means nothing. i wanted to strike assad and punish him and change the tide of battle. mike, what happens if assad said no, you can't go there? without a chapter seven resolution which the russians are threatening to veto and allows the use of force it means nothing. this is a debacle. >> and where did this whole thing unravel? >> i think when the president came to congress.right after the redline was drawn a year ago. why would assad do it after he was told by obama not to? from benghazi forward, we have been sending a signal that we are weak and a paper tiger. they killed our ambassador and three other americans and a year later nothing happen to anyone. every radical jihaddist is on steroids and assad sized up obama and i will do what i need to to protect myself. and challenge this guy. and the russians and iranians and syrians won the contest and we lost. i worry about what is happening in iran. the only reasonable they are not dancing is because they don't believe in dancing. >> you believe if we don't get the situation in syria resolved we'll be dealing in six months something far more serious beeniran and israel. explain to me what kind of serious situation we'll face in six months? >> iran is the biggest ally of assad. they are linked to the help and russia is helping. and anything we are doing in syria is sending a signal to the iranians. i believe they are building a nuclear weapon and not a nuclear power plant. >> i absolutely believe that. >> look how we handled the chemical weapons threat in syria. if we duplicate that to iranians they will march to the nuclear weapon. our friends in israel will have to take the iranians on unless the united states sends a clear signal to iran unlike we is not to syria. mixed message can't be repeated when it comes to iran. here's what i will do. i will get a bipartisancoalition together and put together a use of force resolution and allow our country to use military force as a last resort to stop the program and make sure they get a clear signal that call of this debacle called syria doesn't mean we are confused about iran. we may be confused with the chemical weapons in syria, but not to do with the program in iran. i mean, republicans and democrats and libertarians and vegetarians all believe that the iranians can't be allowed to get a nuclear weapon and we have to send that signal and i will draft a resolution allowing force to be to stop the nuclear. i need your help and every friend of israel needs to rally. and i will sunday a signal to israel and tel aviv and to the a yatollas. you march to a nuclear weaponall options on the table including military action. >> you are going to seek a preemptive approval to give the president a loaded weapon so he feels the freedom and support of a bipartisan congress to take action including military against iowa ran to prevent them from having nuclear weapons. >> that's right. if they get nuclear weapons. every state will challenge the nuclear ability. i am afraid they would share the technology to terrorist. you are on the rod to a rma getton if they get the nuclear weapon. i will offer a resolution allowing the use of force as a last resort and let the president know all options on the table including military option that congress grease with them. i am not asking him to come tous. mike fwe don't do this soon, this mess in syria will lead to a conflict between israel and iran. the iranians have to believe that america is not serious about the nuclear program after the way putin has led us in a blipped canyon in syria. >> strong stuff. stay with us. last wednesday marked a year since four americans were murdered in benghazi. and senator graham will speak to the survivors about what happen that night. will we ever find out, i will ask the senator when we come back. >> i would like to hear from you. go to my web site mikehuckabee.com and tell me what you think. and sign up for my facebook page and follow me on man: sometimes it's like we're still in college. but with a mortgage. and the furniture's a lot nicer.and suddenly, the most important person in my life is someone i haven't even met yet. who matters most to you says the most about you. at massmutual we're owned by our policyowners, and they matter most to us. as you plan your next step, we'll help you get there.car insurance companies say they'll save you by switching, you'd have, like, a ton of dollars. but how are they saving you those dollars?

(applause)>> on wednesday, state department spokes person faced tough questioning from a p reporter matt lee on request for house oversight and chairman darril issa, to make the survivors of benghazi attacks available for questioning by congress. >> do you see the contradiction here? when he complaining that you are not making people available to him and you say that is not thorough. you are and then you say people are not being made available, that is a problem. >> what i would say to him, we don't understand why anyone would do going to jeopardize the process. >> okay, it is factually correct though then, that the state department or the administration is preventing people specifically the survivors from testifying. >> i don't have. >> for whatever reason it is just true. >> we are back with senatorlindsay graham. and we were talking about dancing. i thought jim was mimmicking ginger rogers. why will not we hear from the survivors from benghazi. >> i think charles wood size one of your next guest. i want to tell mr. woods and every family member who lost a member that losted a loved one in benghazi. we'll get to hear from the survivors. it is a year since the attack and congress is the independent oversight. can you imagine if this was bush how our democratic friends would act. i will stop every nomination and a ponement until the state department agrees to make available to the house and senate those who survived the debacle called benghazi. we need to hear from them what happened and not told by a spokesman what happened.>> how come we are pushing over and over and not begin the answer. they should know it is going to come out. why would the stall continue like this? >> i think the narrative that bin laden was dead and al-qaeda on the run was destroyed by the attack in benghazi. before the attack they had made request for security. chris stephens said we can't defend the consulate. and al-qaeda flags are flying all over the place and why for eight hours no one came to their rescue and how did it start as a protest gone bad spawned by hateful video. i looked at the evidence. mike, there is not one communication from tripoli or benghazi suggesting that there was a protest outside of the consulate. the ambassador went to bed at 9:02. it was a fabrication by theadministration. mr. woods and his family haven't been told the truthment survivors are going to speak and all hell will break out between congress and the state department and ciowa a. we'll not let state department be putin and we obama. we'll push back. the americans need ton what happened to the four brave americans and get to the bottom of it. >> i appreciate your tenacity on this. the american people and the families of those four who were murdered deserve an answer. thanks for standing up for them and pushing back hard. great to have you here. >> thank you, mike. >> senator lindsay graham from south carolina. and when you come back, charles wood will be with us. father of tyroen woods one of the four heroes we lost infall's around the corner. and so is your husqvarna dealer. husqvarna is known for high performing, durable and innovative products. so is it any wonder why your husqvarna dealer is the best in the business at what they do?

>> right after the funeral there was an individual who e-mailed me, his name was peterson and he was an information officer in benghazi. he was basically relaying the distress calls and telling the powers at be what was happening there. he is not a touching e-mail and he said your son's sacrifice saved my life and i would like to talk to you. >> we did. >> what did he tell you. >> unfortunately at the time, i believed the official story and so i didn't know what questions to ask. i wished i had the opportunity to contact him again. i have tried to contact him, he is apparently outside of the united states, and somehow i can't contact him at his e-mail or phone number he gave me.>> what were you told. what he would tell you was different than the official version. it was what? >> the first official version i got that was reicized was from hillary and that was before ty's funeral when the bodies were shipped back to andrews air force base and the famous statement, we are going to prosecute the person that is responsible for the video. >> she talked about the youtube video. >> i had heard about a video in egypt that was the first mention of any video in libya. now she said she was going to get you the truth. did the president also speak to you? >> i spoke with the president and he was grabs and nice for him to take time to come visit with the families. he went to each family group and he came over and shook my hand and i shook his hand and i putmy hand on his shoulder and i said thank you for your service. i was at peace with my son's death even though i grieved quite a bit and i still cry when i think about it. but i told him that you know, my view of reality was this, was that it was ty's time, that god could have prevented that but god anyhow what was best and i think i made a statement that some good will come out of this. did he tell you that you would get the truth or did hillary or anyone tell you that. >> generically the president did offer to reach out to the families, and so far that has not happen. i decided recently to initiate contact and so i did send the president a letter saying thereare several questions that i would like to have answered to bring closure to my family. >> but no contact from the white house, the state department. >> none. none. that's why i initiated contact and i am sure he will. he's busy with syria, and i am sure when his plate is more empty he will respond to that. >> i don't care how full his plate is, you deserve an answer. and the rest of america deserves an answer. and the president should make time to give you and the country as to why your son died. >> it si little late for that. i wished he had taken time the night of september 11th not to go to bed and not to prepare to collect money in las vegas. i wished he had taken time then, to watch more of the video of the lifetime ambush attack ofthe embassy and i wished that he had is not the troops that everyone knows were available to rescue those. it is always the policy of our military to never leave anyone behind and always rescue. (applause) >> that is a question that we also have. >> in this case there was no rescue attempt or planes and ty's body was left on the tarmac for three hours and there was not even an american plane to rescue or take his body home. they had to commander a libyan plane and they didn't know where to be taken in order to remove his body from the tarmac. is that the way to treat an american hero? >> it most certainly is not, charles. that's why all of us in this country are asking that we getanswers. charles' had a lot of people on his side trying to get the answers that he and his family deserve. is he closer to the truth. we are now a clear from benghazi. ♪ it was the best day whoo! yes! ♪ it was the best day ♪ ♪ it was the best day yeah! ♪ it was the best day ♪ecause of yo [sigh] [echoing] we make a great pair.huh? progressive and the great outdoors -- we make a great pair. right, totally, uh... that's what i was thinking. covering the things that make the outdoors great. now, that's progressive. call or click today. ♪ ♪ [ male announcer ] experience new febreze sleep serenity and let the soothing scent of moonlit lavender lull you to sleep.♪ new febreze sleep serenity in moonlit lavender, warm milk & honey, and quiet jasmine. an official product of the national sleep foundation. breathe happy. sleep happy. an official product of the national sleep foundation. from the classic lines to the elegant trim in each and every piece, ♪ kohler will make your reality a dream.it calls for all chemical weapons in syria to be destroyed. now back to huckabee. >> we are back with charles woods, father of navy seal ty woods. jeff duncan held up a photoof ty while questioning secretary of state john kerry on the house hearings in syria. >> this is a picture of toy roen woods a navy seal, the woods family deserve answers and he was killed in benghazi. america deserves answers. before we send americans in a civil war and no clear indication that there is no imminent threat to the unitedstates. >> powerful moment. there is other congressman and septemberors who attempted to get answers. jeff duncan and others pushed for answers. >> i want to tip my hat to jeff duncan. i have spoke ep to him three times. once in his office when i gave him a picture of ty. >> and you gave me. >> thank you. he called me twice. once last spring and he said i appreciated visiting with you and i want you to know that i have taped ty's picture to my computer so that i will not forget. and then right before the anniversary of ty's going home to be with the lord, he called me again, and said i want you to know that i still have your son's picture taped to my computer so that i will not forget. there are really awesome people in d.c. not all of them are there forthe wrong reasons. he's one and other one is jason. we have talked a half dozen times. he even gave me his personal cell phone. and last january, i called him and he happen to be packing up his kids to go to disneyland and he took quite a bit of time out of the schedule and we talked and he mentioned to me, i believe it was october 28th. he went back to libya with general ham. and this was the statement he made to me. he said ""gentleman ham told me that he told the joint chiefs of staff that he had assets available immediately in the area, but he was not given permission to use those assets.

>> thanks, andy. >> you becha. >> what was your favorite grammy moment? >> i would say right around probably like 11:30 or so when the closing credits ran. >> very good. >> the levon helm thing i thought was very good. >> i don't care.>> chris brown losing to frank ocean was amazing. >> let's welcome our guests. go away. she knows top stocks like i know floral smokes. i wear one while nude finger painting. i am here with liiiiiiizzzzz mcdonald. and he is so funny he burps whoopi cushion. i like the sweater vest. and in malaysia, he is considered a jar. he is in the leg chair. my repulsive sidekick, bill schulz. and if thoughtful commentary was a dune buggy i would ride him with my shirt off. he is the editor of ""the daily caller"" and his latest is called"" the lizard king."" >> a block. the lede. that's the first story. >> all right, has life been hell since shooting ubl? the navy seal who killed bin laden is living in obscurityand broke after leaving the military despite the fact he killed bin laden. he was interviewed by the former san francisco chronicle editor and komodo dragon victim for ""esquire."" the shooter to protect his identity retired after 16 years, four years short of a pension. he refuses to cash in on his fame due to the seal code of the quiet professional. in fear of terrorist reprisals he found his only employment option was more guns and overseas deployment as a security contractor, but he is done with that lifestyle. he recalls the day he killed the man responsible for 9-1-1. ""i remember as i watched him breathe out the last part of air i thought, is this the best thing i have ever done or the worst thing i have ever done? "". it was the best. the editor seemed pleased by the piece.>> ever since he got the rogain his hair is coming back. hue can seal -- how can seal, the musician, be allowed to marry and divorce heidi cliewm, but -- heidi klum, but this seal be ignored and treated so poorly. >> it is really bad. the deal was he was apparently served 16 years and just shy of the 20 years, but the guy has scar tissue and tendonitis and blown disks and he doesn't get disability? the president said nobody -- the president has said you are not supposed to be leaving military service without any help whatsoever, and that's what is going on with him. >> it is a travis stey. travisty. when the congressman is done he gets his full pay, rete? >> yes. he gets the pension and the security.jimmy carter has security. >> you also get lap dances. >> of course, income. you get a special pass to these things. >> you know there is at least one desk jockey admiral who takes away his pension. he sits there and give it to this guy. >> it makes no sense. hospital we just give him -- you will only kill bin laden once every hundred years. so it is the bin laden rule. >> you get a mansion and a mod raw tee and $fest million. go away. >> was there not a $10 million reward? >> $25. why can't he get a piece of that? >> theoretically if he had quit the seals like 10 minutes of about and then shot bin laden he would have been eligible, but you are not eligible if you are in the military. >> unacceptable. i was in the navy, old navy. >> i heard incredibly bravestories of your folding. >> folding with valor, they call it. >> and there were times you didn't know what was in that dressing room, but you heard sounds and you kicked the door in. >> i was the first one in. >> and there were no sounds and it was just this poor, shirtless man and you ended up being in the wrong. >> i was terminated. >> you know the one thing we will never get to the bottom of is why you drilled those holes in those rooms. you said it was for surveillance. >> i was doing a little field work there. >> bill, you are the first and only subscriber to esquire. could this be the first article that people read from this magazine? >> i stole it from my barber shop. i don't know he knows he subscribes anymore. if we were to get the pension he would make just as much as the navy choir or the navysingers. i know they sing more than most people at 6:00 every morning. but that is a travisty. there should be a pecking order what you can make after you serve your time. they are not in harm's way like this guy. and why hasn't he just not got a book deal? the only difference is he didn't kill osama and we know his name which is f-ed up. if he can make millions off that, he can do it too. something is not right. he doesn't have to use his name. he can make money. >> isn't rushti still in hiding? >> if hacking out with supermodels in the meat packing district, then yes. >> that guy got more sex mileage out of that fot-wa. he left his wife and hooks up with every hot chick in new york city. >> his only protection is astrict doorman. >> and a condom. >> the irony was cat stevens called for his death apparently which i thought was funny. he would ride into town on a peace train and stab him to death. >> i have two solutions for this. katherine bigelow should have him accept the offer and he can do it in disguise. he can do it dressed as a fat person. there is a show called talk here in england where they have a guy who is testing automobiles. why doesn't he have his own show? it is a reality show about being -- what do you call it when you go to witness relocation? >> you can wear the same mask as the mu jigs. >> there was a magician that gave it away. >> you know who hates him? magicians. >> i love how the seal saw the movie ""zero dark 30"" and saidit was too long. there were mistakes in the movie. >> it was really long. i judge a movie's length by the numbness of my butt. >> how is the movie doing? did he move back in? >> he can start an escort service because he delivered 70 virgins to a tall, hairy guy. >> from a seal to not real. should we shun the toy gun? on free day, a day of the week -- on friday, a day of the week, they talk about the mere existence of toy guns and how they make things oh so difficult for parents. one stressed out mom doesn't know what she is going to do. another said she won't let her kids have water guns because it is dangerous to separate the guns from what they actually do which is kill things. she believes playing with toy guns makes it easier to shoot the real guns. that's the same argument madeby anti-toy gun groups which sponsors toy exchange programs will kids can get awful toys like hula hoops. here is their latest. >> i can see that causing some problems. you can't spell nerf without er. maybe they have a p oi nt. >> this is my favorite new york times story. when you read it, the two people quoted in it, one is a new york-based play write and the other is a new york-based writer. that's my idea of the perfect story. this must be indisik tiff oflarge -- indicative of larger trends. >> i worked as an editor in women's magazines and this is what they would do. we need to inned foo 10 secrets men won't tell women. and they always go, jessica, a freelance writer, amy, a freelance art director. do you realize they talk to everybody on there staff? that's what they do. they don't talk to anybody. >> all of the quotes were about you. >> my boss keeps touching me. >> my co-worker keeps touching me. >> he is dating the mail guy and me? >> scandal. >> do you think toys lead you to an unhealthy fascination with weaponry? >> they shot branches and tree limbs. they will always play with things that -- we had sling shots and bb guns.i think if the mother wants to give up water guns in the house she should have to give up her salad shooter. people have lost eyes by getting a carrot in the cornea. >> i loved wrist rockets and that was worse than a gun. elizabeth, you had an interesting childhood. >> yes, i did. i had a classic 1965 agent m0, 0m and that is it right there. it was a toy gun a teacher took from me. when you take a picture the bottom drops out and turns into a luger. i was so upset a teacher took this from me and then i found it and i have it by my bed and have i my toy gun. these nuns and teachers must be making a killing on ebay after taking the toy guns and then putting them up on ebay. >> that's what the teachersare doing now. that's exactly what they are doing. >> did they take pictures ? >> no, but it was the will couldest thing. this makes me so happy. and then i am thinking about this article and i can tell chicks weighed this on it because when do boys make guns out of cheese? they will use sticks. do boys make guns out of cheese? >> it could be a french kid. bill, your parents let you play with toy heroin and toy cocaine. did it lead you down a particular path? >> oh we found some heroin. what are we going to do with it? >> any of the toy guns i had, you could easily rob a bank with. >> it was a gun, but it didn't have bullets in it. it is different now, but even -- to paraphrase ""jurassicpark"" they will find a way. they will find a way, so it doesn't matter what you do or what you take away from it, kids love projectiles. even if -- >> even if -- i made a list of the things i mentioned in the exchange program and getting hula hoops, what do hula hoops do? they lead young girls to a life of striping because what you are doing is teaching girls to gyrate. you are gyrating and then there are people down the street going oh look at marianne joy rating. -- >> rating. here is a dollar. next thing you know she is at the boo boo lounge off highway 12 turning tricks for bill's meth habit. >> monopoly and the game candy land. >> duck duck goosediscrimination. >> the wall street greedy banker. >> musical chairs. >> the game of sorry. overly apologetic. >> animal abuse. >> exactly. kerplunk, problems with your digestive system. >> mousetrap animal hater. >> patty cake, patty cake, pro patties and cake. >> operation. animal mutilation. >> killing bin laden. >> my little pony, aryan youth?

are you surprised? she is a delight. she is a delightful person.>> women love her because she is a strong educated woman and she takes you back. >> how much does the favorable press help her? nobody asks tough questions. >> she has had a free pass her whole career. except when she ran against obama, of course. but she is the most popular politician in the country, but she is no longer a politician. she doesn't have to debate. she does president have to take the top policy [stances|instances] and this terms of debating other people she gets to travel the world. it is a tough job. but what has she done that is the remarkable thing?

>> no. i think she is a nonobama person. that's what is going on. they are thinking, hey, what would the country have been like if hillary won? >> i don't think that's the case. now they are looking at -- it is another four years. they are either dead or old. and so the only people who know her are people going she seems like a nice person. the older you get the more respected you get. she was a horrible trader. you -- care to learn anything from it?>> it shows how by polar conservatives are. it is persona-nongrata. >> and now they love her. look at sarah palin. three years ago, bell of the ball. now somebody says mama grizzly , it is empty aside from her. i don't know any conservatives that fall over hillary. >> i don't think they call her a secret muslim. >> coming up, what are the keys to a successful investment strategy?

News Headquarters : FOXNEWS : May 18, 2013 1:00pm-2:00pm EDT",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-400,mpeg2video,2013,"make it a great day. >> a fox news alert on a new bombshell in the irs scandal as a top government watchdog official reveals that members of the obama administration were aware of the tax agency's inappropriate auditing of conservative political groups as early as june of last year. right in the heat of the 2012 election season. hello, everyone. i'm kelly wright. >> what a week, kelly. big story and there is so much more. hi, everybody. i'm jamie colby. we welcome you to a brand-new hour inside america's news headquarters. kelly referring, treasury inspector general jay russell george testified during yesterday's first congressional hearing into that scandal, saying specifically that he alerted senior officials at the treasury department about what was going on. >> i subsequently alerted the general counsel of the department of the treasury onjune 4 and subsequently, and i do not have the exact date -- alerted the deputy secretary, neil wollen, about this matter. >> those are just the latest revelations, raising more questions about what the obama administration knew about the irs controversy and when. molly henneberg live in washington. hi, molly. >> hi, jamie and kelly. the treasury inspector general may have known in june 2012, the deputy treasury secretary may have been informed then about the allegations as well. but treasury secretary jack lew, who took over as treasury earlier this year, said he learned most of the details about the targeting about a week ago. what's not clear is if anyone relayed that information in 2012 or 2013 about the tax agency baring down on conservative groups to the white house. and who decided to start that targeting in the first place. meanwhile, republicans also are raising questions about sarah hall ingram, a top irs official who was the head of the irs'stax exempt division while this targeting was going on. here you can see her bonuses and salaries during the time that conservative groups were feeling the heat from the tax agency. now ingram is in charge of the irs's office that will implement obamacare, monitoring everyone's health insurance and taxes and fines associated with the health care law. and that worries some in the gop. >> she provided horrendous customer service under her watch and now she's going to do the same implementing obamacare. swell. this is the perfect -- this is a perfect example of why we need tax reform. >> but democrats say ingram's successor did not find out about the targeting until six months after. ingram was reassigned to the obamacare division and say it's unfair to suggest she had anything to do with the targeting. >> you're satisfied with miss ingram being in charge of the irs responsibilities now? >> i have heard that i don'tknow personally, but i've heard that she has a high degree of professionalism and that she was not in a position of responsibility over these actions. >> democratic congressman sandra levin said there is no evidence that ingram had, quote, any inkling of the problems in that tax exempt division that she used to head. jamie and kelly. >> molly henneberg, thank you so much. much more on this story coming up. kelly? >> thank you. members of the group who say they were singled out by the irs and had their tax exempt status either severely delayed or denied all together are now taking their case to court. american center for law and justice executive director majorrerren sekulow, who represents more than a dozen of these tea party groups, says he will likely file a civil suit next wednesday or thursday. listen. >> they suffered damages. they lost membership and donations. they missed the election cycle. they missed key moments. they were not able to bringspeakers in. so the irs, this is far from over. >> sekulow adds it's still unclear whether the case will be filed as a class action suit or individually in the 17 different states where the complaints originate. >> coming up later in this program, we're going to speak with republican congressman james languageford of oklahoma who will be taking part in another upcoming hearing into the irs scandal about what his committee is hoping to uncover.   new details in another scandal consuming the white house, a congressional panel trying to determine if there was some sort of cover-up in the days after the deadly attack at the u.s. consulate in benghazi, libya. the chair of the oversight committee is demanding that retired ambassador thomas pickering testify behind closed doors. pickering headed up an internal review of the state department following that terrorist attack. elizabeth prann now following the latest developments. she joins us in washington live. good to see you. >> you, too. that request coming from thechairman of the house oversight committee. he did so in the form of a letter, one of many. but this week, however, it includes a subpoena to the co-chair of the independent review board known as arb that investigated the september 11 terrorist attack in benghazi. darrell issa is speaking more transparency into what happened that day, writing in part to ambassador pickering, the arb worked behind closed doors. it did not record its interviews, even now, months after the arb report was released, the arb's investigative process has remained opaque. darrell issa and other republicans want him to appear on capitol hill on thursday. >> i also want to know who he talked to. i want to know if he talked to alt survivors. uma, there are people with firsthand knowledge. i don't mean congressmen and ambassadors. there were people on the ground in benghazi and know exactly what happened with respect to all three raunches. >> the committee senior democrat issuing his own statement.quote, the subpoena is a stock example of republican overreach and the shameful politicalization of this tragedy. republicans remain focused on getting more information, explaining what happened that night. they want to review video surveillance and fill in the gap between the consulate attack and the white house talking points e-mail release which occurred this week. john boehner is urging the administration to be completely transparent and reveal all communications in the hours immediately after the attack. kelly, back to you. >> elizabeth prann reporting from washington today. >> meanwhile, the president and the administration officials are already trying to tamp down and move on quickly from the developing scandals that are engulfs the white house. the white house chief of staff telling staffers in the west wing, listen to this: that he expects them to spend no more than 10% of their time on the controversy. is that even possible? let's ask matt, a former white house political director under president george w. bush and mark, democratic analyst andformer campaign aide for john kerry and barak obama. gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon, welcome. >> thanks. >> matt, let me ask you about this statement from the chief of staff saying we have other things to do. can you really just focus 10% of your attention on all of this? it's not just the irs. it's benghazi. it's others. >> yeah, if you think about most of the staffers in the white house complex are there to support the president and his policy agenda and his reputation and with the press. so it won't be 10% of their time that will be spent on this scandal. it's more like 90% of their time that will be spent on this scandal. the problem is there is no scandal. there are scandals. they did an effective job under the administration at pushing these disclosures past the election date. the problem with being so effective in pushing them past the election date is that each one of these very serious policy questions and oversight questions is now hitting at the same time right at the time when the president would like topivot and actual lea have a second term agenda. i can't say in the strongest terms how serious this is in terms of barak obama's second term. if he could get out of this, i think he'll see a second term that accomplishes very little. >> mark, the other things on president obama's agenda are important adds well. he wants to implement obamacare. he wants to provide jobs. here is what he had to say this week. i want to ask you about it. >> others may get distracted by chasing every pleading issue that passes by. but the middle class will always be my number one focus, period. your job, your family, your communities. that's why i ran for president. >> mark, my question is, is the middle class not affected? are you willing to say by the irs situation, if they were a tea party or patriot donator, or the benghazi situation where four americans were killed? >> the middle class in america is deeply affected by ournational security and integrity of our irs that's why the president took decisive action this week, firing the head of the irs and is launching now three different investigations. the one is being launched through congress. you've got another investigation and doj criminal investigation into the irs. i think the president shares american's outrage at what's happening now and is channeling that outrage and taking decisive action. i also think one thing matt said is really smart, that the president is trying to pivot. americans -- >> why is it smart? >> sure. americans aren't as obsessed as maybe we in the punditry class are maybe with these different controversies. they want to know that their job is secure. they want to know that we're going to be able to get to a balanced budget eventually. they want to know, for example that, our national security is being restored with new legislation that protects our embassy personnel, that protects our consulate personnel and republicans and congress would want nothing more than to continue this side show anddistract the presidency from doing the work he was elected to do. >> you seem to suggest then, mark, and i understand that you have worked in the administration for the president, that the american public isn't concerned about transparency, which is something that the president really talked so much about in the campaign. so matt, let me ask you, the latest twist seems to be that the administration may have known or the irs may have known during the campaign season that these groups were being targeted, groups that may have not supported the president or his platform. how is that impacted? >> there is no may here. it's very clear that the president's pick to be the general counsel at the department of treasury and deputy secretary of department of treasury were told about this i.g. investigation. it probably also means they knew of potential wrongdoing even before that investigation wasinitiated. so now we have this whole conversation about how far up the chain this information went. if anything inappropriate was done. the problem here is the question of timing. clearly the number one goal of the first term of the obama administration was to get a second term and having these embarrassing revelations come out before election day would have had a negative impact on their chances. they did everything they could to delay these findings and we're going to find out, look, i'm not going to make an allegation. we'll find out. >> let me jump to mark. mark, you mentioned that the investigations are ongoing, the president has called for answers. this we know. the question i have is this other latest twist, that the person that was responsible for giving these exemptions and directing more investigation or tougher standards on those conservative groups has now been put in charge of implementing obamacare. your comments. >> right. my comments are if you think that for a moment that the president or the chief of staffhave knowledge of every federal employee and where they're appointed or if every capitol police officer that shows up late for work somehow -- is a responsibility of the president, no. look. >> please. >> this is important and in thank is why this is important. our economy is rebounding, but not very fast. we want all americans for this job growth to occur. we want for national security. we need to focus on the very real challenges our country faces collectively and so this hasn't been the best week for the administration politically, but i think the president has handled it well. any time he addressed this head on, he released 100 e-mails that -- to show transparency and demonstrate to walk the walk when you talk the talk of transparency. and you have republicans in congress -- >> how about when this occurred? >> fabricated and misled the american people. why aren't we focused on this? >> guys, i got to leave it there. i appreciate that both of youhave made the point on both sides. everybody is look for answers. it's a great concern and we will follow all the developments with you as well. thanks. >> thank you. >> kelly? >> something else, we are tracking some new tensions on the korean peninsula. why north korea has reportedly just test fired three short range missiles. >> fox news obtaining a classified report about the pakinstani doctor who helped the u.s. track down osama bin laden. was his plea for help denied by the united states? >> plus, congress scheduling another hearing into the irs audit scandal. coming up, we will speak to a member of

is there anything at all? is there any way that we could ask you, is there any question you should have asked? my goodness, how much money do you have in your wallet? who do you get e mails from? this is a tax question? you don't think that's intimidating? it sure as hell is intimidating and i don't know that i got any answers from you today and i don't know that -- what mr. george has done is great work, but there is a heck of a lot more that has to come out and anybody to sit here today and listen to what you have to say, i am more concerned today than i was before and the fact that you all can do just about anything you want to anybody, you know you can put anybody out of business that you want any time you want. i got to tell you, you talk about you're a horribly run organization, if you're on the other side of the fence, you're not given that excuse. when the irs comes in, you're not allowed to be shoddy or runhorribly. you're not allowed to do one damn thing that doesn't come in compliance. if you do, you're held responsible right then. i just think the american people have seen what's going on right now in their government. this is absolutely an overreach and this is an outrage for all america. i yield back. [ applause ] >> mr. griffin is recognized for five minutes. thank you. >> kelly: that's just a little bit of the fireworks that took place on friday. the next hearing on the irs controversy will be held on wednesday by the house government oversight and government reform committee, i should say. so joining us now is republican congressman james langford of oklahoma. he's a member of that committee. congressman, your colleague is right on point even winning applause. a lot of people who get in trouble with the irs better have some answers when the irs comes knocking on their door. otherwise they're going to face all kinds of retribution. so when you have a hearing,especially of this magnitude and steven miller comes apparently unprepared, what's your reaction to what you saw yesterday? >> this is typical from the administration. this is the way they play it. they say, we didn't get the information. we weren't aware of it. we're still investigating it. and it's a constant slow walk. what really occurred in this situation was nonprofit groups that were conservative made an application. they were asked for a lot of additional paperwork that liberal groups were not asked for and they were never given an answer. this is the pattern of this administration. multiple agencies do it. it's as clear as things like the keystone pipeline. there are people talking about the keystone pipeline say why is that such a big deal? that's exactly what it is. every previous administration has -- this one constantly asks for more paperwork and delays in giving an answer. they don't say no, they just never give an answer. it's epa, it's in the department of education. it's in the state department. it's in the irs. this is not some isolated event. this is the latest of multipleevent of where they decide they don't like something, so they just delay and never give you an answer to be able to control things. >> kelly: can you imagine someone doing that to the irs when they're facing trouble? >> no. no. if you have a situation with the irs, you have to get it in right now and there are no excuses. they don't have to abide by the same rules. >> kelly: you pay hefty fines or risk going to jail. congressman, we now know through testimony given before the house ways and means committee that jay russell george, treasury inspector general for tax administration, that he informed the treasury department, the inspector general was actually reviewing the irs case and that he of the 2012 election campaign. so are you concerned the obama administration may have known about all this, about these irs practices earlier than what they've testified to? >> there is no question the administration. people in the administration knew. they're always trying to point it back to did the president know? we're not going to know on that. there is not going to be some e-mail that says, mr. president, here is how we're targeting teaparty groups. they're more careful than that. back channels in the, who the administration and others o'clock probably so. this kind of explosive thing that occurred once the i.g. reports starts to go, someone is going to let everyone know. hey, this is now being investigated and yes, there are some, as the president would say, there is some there there in this situation. >> kelly: and meantime, sarah hall ingram, who once ran the irs tax exempt office, which is accused in this matter of singling out conservative groups is now in charge, as you know, sir, of the irs handling the implementation of obamacare. she is responsible for making sure that working people buy health insurance or provide it with government subsidies if they can afford it. do you think she should be the one in that leadership position? >> these were low level folks in cincinnati when it first came out and it was isolated. now we find out it was not only management, but she was bonussed heavily during this time period for doing a good job. and then moved from that job tothe job of running the obamacare for the irs. what qualified her for that promotion? why -- did she do such a good job for the administration in the nonprofit area that she was recognized and say, we now need to you move to the obamacare? we're going to have to find out. there's a lot of questions there. but we need to know who else was applying for the same job. what were the qualifieses -- qualifications. here is our new priority take on this one. >> kelly: all right. the president and the white house say they were not aware of the irs targeting any group or any investigation. the president even expressed outrage over it. the issue, though, are you satisfied with explanations given from the president as well as from the white house over this matter, as well as other scandals? we're look at benghazi, looking at the associated press and the justice department. are you satisfied with the way the white house is responding to either of these scandals?>> every scandal they walk into, they do the exact same thing, this slow walk it. they'll dump a bunch of documents that is publicly available and say we gave you 1,000 pages, things off the web site or publicly available or a few documents, but not the documents that we asked for. and then they'll delay. realize, we still have a contempt of congress out with eric holding over fast and furious because they still have not turned the documents over that their internal investigation did. they've still not turned those documents over to congress. this is an administration that feels like they're above the law. the clearest example of this is the nlrb and nonrecess, recess appointments. they put people in place that never had been through the constitutional process and then do all these things, two different courts have said that's unconstitutional. you can't do that. you have to stop. they keep going. this pattern has to stop. >> kelly: what are we going to see from your committee next week, sir? >> we're going to continue to press for names. we're going to press for the documents. everything the irs does is heavily documented. if those documents are missing, there has got to be a reason forcertain documents to be missing. we want to know what is the paper trail and what people were connected to it, who made the decisions and why were those decisions made and why specifically were conservative groups targeted out, liberal groups were expedited. >> kelly: congressman, we thank you for joining us this afternoon. i know you took some time off to do that. we appreciate you spending your saturday with us. have a good day. >> glad to be with you, thanks. >> kelly: it continues. >> jamie: i mentioned there's a possible break in the case of madeline mccann, the investigation i guess has been ongoing. certainly that case grabbed national attention. a little girl six years ago, four years old from britain vanishing from her family's vacation home in portugal and now scotland yard is saying it has new leads. we have the latest details just ahead. >> kelly: we want to follow that. plus o. j. simpson's former defense attorney with some damaging testimony in the former football star's bid to get a new trial for armed robbery. what the lawyer says o.j. knew about the night he and two men went to that vegas hotel room toretrieve some of his sports memorabilia. >> based on my conversations with mr. simpson on the day after the event, he had told me that he did, in fact, ask alexander, he knew that he had screwed up. he knew there were guns in the room. the boys used double miles from their capital one venture card to fly home for the big family reunion.you must be garth's father? hello. mother. mother! traveling is easy with the venture card because you can fly airline anytime. two words. double miles! this guy can act. wanna play dodge rock? oh, you guys! and with double miles you can actuay use, you never miss the fun. beard growing conte and go! ♪ win! what's in your wallet?try align. it's the number one ge recommended probiotic that helps maintain digestive balance. ♪ stay in the groove with align. ♪ need help keeping your digesve balance in sync? try align. it's a probiotic that fortifies your digestive system with healthy bacteria 24/7. because your insides set the tone. stay in the groove with align.>> jamie: more on those stunning new developments in the case of the missing british girl, madeline mccann. investigators in the u.s. or u.k. rather, say they have identified a number of people of interest after they rereviewed the case. madeline vanishing from her family's vacation apartment in portugal back in 2007. her parents had gone out to dinner and left her in the room. she was four years old at the time. police initially did suspect her parents were involved, but the couple was cleared in 2008.we're keeping an eye on the case for you. more as we get it. >> kelly: some surprising new testimony in o. j. simpson's hearing to get a new trial on his armed robbery conviction. simpson's former defense attorney taking the witness stand telling the judge what simpson knew about that night in a las vegas hotel room back in 2008, you'll recall. dominic deany tool with more from our los angeles bureau. >> it was a week of courtroom drama like we haven't seen in quite a long time. we certainly watched o.j. appear before a judge many times previously, but this week was the first time he had ever taken the stand and testified in his own defense. on wednesday, he was allowed one hand to be unshackled to explain evidence presented to demonstrate how his former attorney had poorly represented him in that 2008 case. that case centered around charges of theft and taking hostages at gun point in the vegas hotel room. as o.j. tried apparently toreclaim valuable personal memorabilia. the former nfl star's central argument is galanter knew in advance he was going to try and take back his stuff and hence, was given bad advice. >> you think you were acting legally? >> yes, i do. >> and why is that? >> well, my stuff. i followed what i thought the law and my lawyer told me. >> he challenged both the defendant and the judge flew into a rage at that accusation. >> did mr. simpson never told me the night before that he was going to go into the palace station with a bunch of thugs that he asked to bring guns, keep people in a room and forcibly take his property back. and the insinuation that i would have blessed it or anybody else would w a license to practice law would have blessed it isinsane. >> you could really see him fuming there. it wasn't -- it was an incredible exchange, rounding out a week of fireworks. with no jury, the judge's decision is expected in the next couple of weeks and experts seem to think o. j. simpson has a good chance of getting a new trial. back to you. >> kelly: thanks so much. >> jamie: we have to take a closer look at what this means for o. j. simpson. what does it mean for galanter. let's bring in our panel. david schwartz, also criminal defense attorney, former prosecutor, two of the folks i would call if i were in trouble. good to have you both here. >> thank you. >> jamie: rebecca, how thigh hay is the standard -- high is the standard to prove that a lawyer has been ineffective? >> it's a very high standard and i think what we're look at here is o.j. making a very desperate attempt that really doesn't make any rational sense. the idea that yale galanter would actually tell him to commit a crime because as weknow, what o.j. did, going into a hotel room armed subject to being disbarred and being put in jail for conspiracy of criminal behavior is outrageous. >> jamie: so you're saying it's probably not worth the risk. we are even under as attorneys an obligation if we know a client is going to commit a crime to notify authorities? >> absolutely. >> jamie: david, there are three things that o.j. is saying. one, i was told not to take the stand. i wasn't really given a choice. two, there were plea deals on the table, i wasn't informed of. three, he is saying that his attorney told him to go ahead and commit the crime. and the other one i had was, yeah, that his attorney said to go for it. there was also local counselthat was on the team, second chair probably, 'cause i don't believe yale was admitted in that state. so the question is why bring the case at all? it seems to me there is a risk for o.j he's up for parole in a couple of years and the things that are coming out may not be helpful in that hearing. >> that's true. but he's the one that's sitting in jail right now. certainly he has a right to bring the argument and i think criminal defendant should have the right to do that. so i think any of those three items will rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel? absolutely not. when you look at the strickland case, united states supreme court case, there have been lawyers that have fallen asleep. there have been lawyers that have been on drugs. there have been lawyers that have been under the influence of alcohol during the trial, and those were still determined to be effective assistance of counsel. >> jamie: that is such an interesting analysis and good information on this. so now, david, you heard o.j., i want to ask both of you on the stand, how compelling a witness is he now?how compelling would he have been if, in fact, it made sense for him to take the stand? >> i agree rebecca on that stand to accuse your attorney of a serious crime like that, you better have the evidence and you better have the back up. so if it's just o.j.'s word versus yale galanter's word, yale galanter is going to win the day. he's a credible attorney. he happened to do a very nice job during that trial and certainly he was effective during that case and i wouldn't give his testimony any credibility whatsoever. that's o.j. >> jamie: the judge will value all the evidence. that's clearly your opinion. rebecca, i'll ask you as well, how would o.j. prove that yale galanter told him, go and get your stuff and knowingly that there were weapons involved, o.j. was going to ask for guns, let him go he had and do that. how does he prove it? >> he doesn't prove it. it becomes his word against galanter's word. in a normal case you say, well, we're going to weigh it fairly. but in this case, you have o. j. simpson who has been clearlyproblematic over the course of time. >> jamie: can i bring up one more thing? >> absolutely. >> jamie: before we go, a lot of people say that he's in prison right now not for going and grabbing his memorabilia, but because they believe he killed his wife and her friend. so the question is, could he have made an argument that there was some prejudice against him for sentencing due to a prior crime? >> he could have made that argument, but the jury came to a conclusion that he was guilty on these counts. so any argument that he may make in that vein doesn't really hold any water in a court of law. it may be all of his publicity and all of his nonsense, but the reality is, we had jurors who decided fairly. i am sure, i go to court every day. i select juries. jurors want to do the right thing in every case. they did not punish him. >> jamie: we thank the jurors for their service. david, i wish i had more time, but i know you'll follow it and please come back. >> absolutely.>> jamie: have a great day. kelly? >> kelly: i got a question for you, can you put the salt shaker back on the kitchen table? it turns out that salt may not be so bad for you after all. dr. spotty will explain. and do you have your ticket? powerball could make you an instant multi-millionaire. just remember to share it with me.♪ [ male announcer ] sixty-two horsepower. fifty-three miles per hour. the gator rsx 850i. it's a whole new species of gator.>> jamie: you have got to be in it to win it. that's right. powerball fever is sweeping our country. the jackpot closing in on yet another record. tonight's drawing currently $600 million. you say that's not enough for you? well, it could go higher. that's just 56 million shy of the record set in 2012 by mega millions and if you don't see kelly or me tomorrow, you will know it's ours.[ laughter ] >> kelly: for many years, we've been told to take it easy with the salt shaker or just put it back on the shelf. but now a new study, a government study, by the way, saying there is little benefit seen in sharp limits on salt in your diet. but is this salt shakeup really true? dr. david samati, a member of the fox news medical a team and the chief of the division of robotics at mount sinai hospital joins us now to weigh in o this. government sponsored study, talking about 1500-milligrams of sodium and say hey, it's cool. you can do it. but what about those who have high blood pressure and kidney ailments and other things that could make them prone to having their disease increase because of salt? >> it's unfortunate that this article came out because i think we're just confusing more and more people. one week we say like no salt and now we say salt is actually good for you. so you got to be cautious. both of them, american heart association and this instituteof medicine agreed that if you're over the age of 50, african-americans, blood pressure, diabetes, make sure that you stick to 1500-milligrams. how much is that of salt? it's about half a teaspoon. average americans today are using about 3400-milligrams. double the amount. and basically with just a hamburger, french fries and one lunch, you can get about your 1500-milligram of salt. >> kelly: that's the point. there is already salt in enough of the food that we consume on a daily basis. so then i read this study and think, i'm not going to trust that because it's detrimental to my health if i put the salt back on the table and sartre using it. >> you're absolutely right. the truth is in the processed food and all the bread and pizza and soup and all these other, you're ready getting enough amount of salt. that's what makes the food actually tastier. so you're right. the message you should be telling everybody is, get rid of that salt because you're gettingenough. if you're going to started aing to it, that's when we're going to get to that 3400. we know that too much salt is going to increase your triglyceride and make your insulin resistant. then you have obesity and stroke. forget about it. it's not worth it. as it is, you're getting enough amount of salt and i agree with you. i think this is going to be confusing and the good thing is that american heart association is a little angry. they're still holding their stand saying 1500-milligrams is and we're not going to budge. too much salt is not good for you. everybody knows that. i think this is just the study that's done by the government and their excuse is that you need a little salt to be able to function. i'm not worried about it. we're getting enough of it. so my message to a lot of people out there is no salt on the table. you're getting enough. >> kelly: it's not mary poppins just a spoon full of sugar. >> jamie: i got a suggestion. you can not eat french fries without salt. so you got to cut the french fries. >> that's the start. that's a way to go.i'm glad you have a great voice. you're right. sugar a whole debate. mayor bloomberg is getting involved. i'm sure he's gog get involved with this also. but salt is really -- once you have the blood pressure and your hormones are going to kick in, that's what you have heart disease. number 3400 hasn't really changed over the decade. despite everything we've done. so i think this is just going to confuse a lot of people. just because they're saying there is not enough data that less than 3400 will help you, it doesn't people -- >> kelly: hopefully you made it clear. >> jamie: tomorrow we have so many great topics but on the salt issue, look at the processed foods and see what's in their. we're going to have much more tomorrow not only dr. samadi, but dr. siegle and guess what, a special treat. kelly wright is joining me because eric shaun is on assignment. >> kelly: a pleasure being withyou. >> jamie: we will see you in thr morning. takeyb care you suggested luxury car service instd of ""strength training with patrick willis."" come on todd! flap them chicken wings.

Van Susteren : FOXNEWS : February 22, 2013 10:00pm-11:00pm EST",Port 1236,tv@archive.org,-500,mpeg2video,2013,"lies, propaganda, disportion and pretty sad especially with the president. and let not your heart be troubled. have a nice weekend. greta is here next and we'll see you again monday. >> tonight, are you ashamed? rush limbaugh says you should be. >> it makes me ashamed that we have sunk and descended to this level in our politics. >> the white house now trying to push back and make the political argument of their own, that this is going to be really a harmful and it's going to hurt the public. >> and you see this anytime any government agency has to cut this budget and is threatened with any sort of budget cut. it puts out the story that's likely to create the greatest amount of fear. >> and they have to spend time refuting such things as air traffic control will shut down. the military will shut down. this won't be anyfirefighters. there won't be any cops and not once, folks, we're now into the 7th or 8th episode of this in the last two years. >> the president's using his bully pulpit and he's scaring people and bringing out the voices and you unleashing his cabinet to do the whole dog and pony show around the country. >> the indiscriminate deep cuts will affect everyone, really, in america. >> travelers should expect delays. >> be it this, the questionster, be it the fiscal cliff argument. be it one of arguments over raising the debt limit. in each case, we've been forced to refute a bunch of out and out ridiculous lies. >> the president is making stuff up. he puts law enforcement, he puts firemen and policemen, who 98% of them are paid for with your local taxes and say you're going to lose your local policemen because of this. it's not true.and while all of this is happening, while all of these allegations, austerity, what we're actually doing is ruining the country and spending more than we had. and creating more dependence. the whole thing is shamefully absurd. >> the sequester deadline now just one week away and the gps, superpac launched by karl rove launching a new video called obama's mess. >> you're in washington and sequestration are a bad idea. are you willing to see a bunch of first responders lose their jobs. teachers laid off. senior, airport security. scrambling to find child care, and vaccinations and cancer screenings, a bad idea, a booed idea. >> the sequester was the administration's idea. >> they were president obama's idea. >> the so-called sequester wasthe president's idea and signed it into law. >> the white house recommended it and back in august. >> and it seems like every three months around here, there's some manufacturing crisis. >> from our new york city mayor rudy guiliani joins us, good evening, mayor. >> good evening, greta. how are you. >> i'm well. i assume this video was put out to poke a little fun at the president and bob woodward by the way, put online that the president and jack lew had it wrong that it was the president and administration's idea to come up with sequestration, what difference does it make? >> the president has created this doomsday scenario in order to, you know, frighten people into avoiding the kind of cuts we have to make in order it balance our budget.i mean, the person doing damage to america is president obama. who is going to pay it, your children, my dinner, they're going to pay it and they're going to have to pay that debt for his overspending and they're creating real peril for the american economy, long-term substantive peril, all of the stuff that you just had on. this is been going on for, 20, 30 years, we're going to lose the statue of liberty and the buildings are going to fall down and no police on the street and i heard that when i was mayor of new york, i had to cut 2.3, 2.4 billion and they tried to make it sound like the city was going to disappear. we cut it, the city is better off than it's been before. and fiscal discipline is something that a president is going to have to bring to government. if he couldn't, it's hard for the legislator to do it. he's been fiscally the most undisciplined president in theunited states. >> couple of things, the fact that he doesn't seem it remember it was his white house idea and he okayed it on the sequester and either means he has a bad memory, which is not a good sign or he's trying to be petty or trying now that he finds himself in hot water to blame somebody else that looks petty. the second thing for the life of me, i don't understand this and see if, if i'm correct, but as i understand this so-called cut is that-- is that february 28th we have a certain level of spending, on march 1st, that spending is supposed to go up. and what the sequestration does, it says it doesn't go up as much as we wanted it. so, it really isn't that we're cutting anything, so if we're not cutting anything, why are we laying people off? i mean, i don't get like. >> it's childish. greta. >> greta: i don't get this. >> this is so childish. these people shouldn't be governing us. this is silly, you're absolutely right. this is not a cut in spending. this is cutting how much more we were going to spend.so it isn't a cut, it's a reduction in the amount of money, we're still going to spend more and you look at the percentage that it is of our entire federal budget. to make the claims that the country is going to end is just as false as his claim he wasn't responsible for the sequester. remember, he made that claim during the third debate with romney and jack lew immediately misrepresented and supported it and took woodward to come out that it was totally false and untrue and i think ""the washington post"" gave the president four pinochios for make the false statement. a completely false statement. it was his idea, it's a stupid idea. it's a side that shows how irresponsible he's been in dealing with our economy. and this has been the worst president for our economy in the history of this country. >> i know, but tell me how-- i hear the story about peoplegetting pink slips and i don't want people to suffer. if we have a sequestration and we have a slowed spending increase, why would anyone even be laid off? because we're spending more even with the sequestration. >> i don't get it, greta and the people he's talking about are being laid off are paid for by state and local budgets. and those firefighters and rescue workers and everything else, they're paid for by, you know, the city of los angeles and the city of new york and the state of california and the state of texas and these are not -- we're not talking about federal workers, no reason for massive layoffs if it's just a reduction in the increase in spending and not a real reduction in spending. maybe there'll be some layoffs, but not massive layoffs and you know something, the federal government needs some layoffs. we employ way too many people in the federal government and that's why we're spending a trillion dollars more than we have. if anybody thinks the federal government is efficient, then you're on mars. the federal government ishighly inefficient. it could use a 5 or 10% cut. it will make it a lot more efficient. >> greta: and always nice to see you, mayor. >> thank you very much, greta. he see you soon. >> greta: thank you, sir. virginia governor bob mcdonnell joins us and governor, nice to see you, and you believe that sequestration will hurt your state. is that correct? >> well, i do, but more importantly, i think it's going to hurt national security and it's going to balance the fiscal problems of the united states on the backs of the men and women in uniform. we love the military here in virginia, but the policy is just reckless, it was put in place 18 months ago, really to be a hammer and get people to talk and guess what they failed. the president hasn't led and congress can't get a deal. the fiscal health of our country is dysfunctional. now, we've got 50% of all of this 1.2 billion dollars in cuts on the backs of the military and that's wrong about it and there's no takingon entitlements. that's the problem, a bad policy. >> couple of things, is means 2.4 cents on every dollar for the increased spending that we're planning, not on existing spending, but what was the spending that's going to go up as of march 1st, so 2.4 cents. the second thing is, there's something fundamentally wrong where the people who make these decisions, make the incompetent decisions if they think that sequestration is really a bad idea and they're the ones that make it, and they're not the ones that are going to pay the piper on this. that's the unfortunately thing. if the president and jack lew came up with a really dumb idea and the republicans thought, gee, that's a really good idea we're going to join your dumb idea and everyone else is supposed to suffer, go figure. >> well, what's the deal on august 11th and we didn't go over the fiscal cliff, greta and have the debt ceiling expire and everyone thought the super committee would get it worked out and the president handled that in the third debate he picked it anddoesn't get it done. >> governor, it failed in november of 2011 and what did everybody do between 2011 and now, nothing. the president played golf and congress went on recess, everyone took, everyone took this time. pay the piper on this. they went to work and nothing to stop them after the super committee failed to actually get down to work and instead they did. and we're sad they campaigned to get their jobs back. >> you're exactly right. look, it takes leadership and it starts at the top. the president is the commander-in-chief and his own secretary of defense says the cuts will be devastating. the united states military and national security and now the president is running around doing press conferences when he should be in a room with congress trying to figure it out. here is the problem, greta. we need to cut. the sequester is only 1.2 billion dollars, that's not even one year of the deficit so it's a drop in the bucket and we've got to do a lot more with a 17 trillion dollar debt, but you don't do half of it it on your men and women in uniform when you're trying torecognize a peace dividend and war in iraq and unsettled around the world and that's the fundamental problem and it's a reckless policy. >> well, i'd like to see the pentagon get audited and that's only fair and we don't do that. look at the last time we we reported on the record, july 2011 and june 2012 that the department of labor paid 5 billion in improper unemployment benefits so i suspect if we got 5 billion at labor in one year, i suspect the pentagon has got some issues, too, but we can't get an audit of the pentagon. >> no, i don't think there's any question about it, the $300 hammer story. there's no question every area of tit should be cut. not 12% of the of the budget and 50% of the cost of the sequester when you don't even touch entitlement spending. greta, everybody in washington knows you can't balance the budget and you can't get the spending and debt under control unless you take on entitlements. the president won't do it. and so, until he leads. and we're not going to getanywhere. >> boy it's going to be interesting to see what happens a week from now, governor. as always, nice to see you, sir. >> okay. thanks, greta. appreciate it it. >> donald trump has a warning, he's predicted a big fat explosion, we spoke with donald trump a short time ago. >> nice to see you. okay, tell me, what happens if sequester goes into effect and we have the across the board cuts and what's going to happen with the economy, with jobs, there are lots of things people are saying are going to happen. so you tell me? >> well, i think not a lot is going to happen. it's a very small percentage of the cuts that need to be made and i think really, it's overexaggerated and a lot of things are not going to happen that people are thinking are going to happen and frankly, this is a very minor amount of attempts have to be made ultimately and a lot of people are saying that even democrats are saying that. >> it's hard to understand because there are a lot of scary things that are being said. the president says, the lines of tsa are going to be verylong and in order to cut down on prosecutors prosecuting cases and what i don't get is this. is that sequestration is a slowed growth, it's not really a cut. so, i'm having a hard time understanding why we don't even just maintain the status quo, how it would have any impact. >> well, i think actually that's going to happen and i think that the cuts are not going to be as deep as you see. i think you'll have to do a lot more cutting if you're going to balance budgets and a lot more cutting and no question about it. everybody knows it, the president knows it, congress knows it and this is just the beginning. >> what happens if we do no cuts at all and you know, in the next year or two, three, four years, let's say we continue to balloon our debt, debt and deficit? >> well, eventually you're going to have a big fat explosion and it's all going to come to an end. if we don't get-- if we're up to 17 trillion dollars in debt. nobody thought that was possible, if you look back 7, 8, 9 years ago, nobody thought that would have been possible.we're at 17 trillion dollars and you know, the word trillion we have been talking a long time, you and i greta. that was not a word in the vocabulary and now it's a very common, it's a very common word and we have to get our debt at least way down. i mean, we should be ashamed of ourselves to what we've let happen. now, the biggest losers are going to be our children, our grandchildren, but it will never be the same unless we do something and this is the time to do it. right now is the time to do it. if we could get the economy rolling, if we could get china and other countries that take the business away that we've just handed them on the silver platter and get our country great again. because it's not great right now. then that would take care of a lot of problems, but we're not doing that. you look at what's going on in india, china, so many countries, you look at what opec is doing to us, greta, with fuel. i see on your show, and on other shows where fuel isgoing to be setting records, records in terms of what's happening, and opec is laughing all the way to the bank. you look at what's happening with this countries, and we're just not going to come back. as somebody that knows what they're doing is in there. >> you used the term ashamed. that we should be ashamed of ourselves unless somebody knows what he's doing is doing the work. i'm curious, why are we in this mess? is it because of incompetence, lack of understanding and it's politics, about winning or a complicated issue? why are we in this mess? >> i think you could say it's all of the above, it's interesting and we're in it certainly because of incompetence. we're in it because we have people that don't know what we're doing and in it because we allowed people, we allowed other leaders of other countries to take our steak off our plate. to take our business away and you go to places, i mean, i go to other places, you go to brazil. you go to so many other countries, china being the number one culprit and you see what they're doing, and it's amiracle. the government has to roll it back, and the government has to keep it back and go up to 10%, 12% and the government does things to keep the business back. >> is president obama, does he have ultimate responsibility? because he's the leader and cost him to speaker boehner and the house republicans because they have so much, they have so much power. who could drive this? >> well, it's really everybody when you think of it. but the president is your leader, the person that has to get everybody into a room and say, hey, folks, let's make a deal and gets things going, we have to bring things back, and all of the things we've talked about over the last couple of years, whether it's medicare, medicaid, social security, it all does take care of itself. if we could get the, you know the engine of this country going again, but the engine, it's broken. it's really a broken country from an economic standpoint. in 2016 china will become the big economic factor of theworld. that was unthinkable if you think back ten years from now, you go back ten years, it was unthinkable, but china will become the big economic power, 2016, that's right around the corner and we let that happen. and they have become the economic power on our bk. >> greta: you mentioned 2016. one last question, are you interested in running in 2016? >> well, i'm not, frankly, i mean, i was really enjoying myself. i really thought that mitt romney would do well. he's a wonderful man, but he didn't resonate, somehow people didn't catch on, he didn't catch on and it just didn't work and that was an election that should have been won. it should have been won easily, but there's a long time to go, there's a long

[ male announcer ] fast, reliable deliveries worldwide. fedex.>> tonight the olympian accused of murdering his model girlfriend is a freeman. at least for now. oscar p oscar pistorius was whipped away from the courthouse after he was granted bail. his uncle speaking after the hearing. >> we are relieved the fact that oscar got bail today. but at the same time we are inmourning for the death of reeva with her family. we know oscar's version of what happened on that tragic night and we know that the truth and that will prevail in the coming date. >> greta: the for the latest, adam wakefield joins us from johannesbu johannesburg, tell me, down where pistorius went after he was released? >> well, the-- very limited number of people within the criminal justice system know where he went, but on twitter to resume to report he went to a friend's house, so, it's unknown where he might be, but logic suggests one or the other. >> greta: what was it like in court today?>> well, hearing finished the closing arguments for the prosecution and generated a lot of discussion in proceeding pistorius did say he was released there would be a flight risk and he indicated the fact that since he wears prosthesis and require maintenance, couldn't get through airport security he wasn't a flight risk and an adjournment and addressed his judgment. ap that was very tense and i think the pistorius family was extremely test as they went through his judgment. >> greta: what is the reception like in south africa in terms of the people? are they split in terms of whether or not he's a hero and this is an unfortunate accident or a cad and a killer and domestic violence? what's the split among the people? >> that's very good question. i think, i think in terms ofwhere public opinion lies on this matter it's been an ebb and flow he. as we've been going through the proceedings day by day, the new information, arguments and defense, caused opinions to change. and the popular news site and asked for about 3000 people and 75% said that it was fair and he was granted bail. and i'm sure activists groups and individuals might not be happy that he was granted bail, that he did receive pr preferential treatment that's what aim hearing from a source. >> greta: thank you. and oscar pistorius faces a rough legal road ahead, next hearing on june 4th. and joining us from capetown, nice to have you. and the 4th of june, the beginning of a trial or some preliminary proceeding. >> greta, no, that's just aprovisional, i think that the trial is many months away, could even be the end of the year or into 2014. obviously, the prosecuting authority in convention with the police will now conduct further investigation. there have been certain problems that have come out in the case with regard to the forensic evidence and contamination ever the crime scene and the investigating officer testified during the the bail hearing, in posting bail for mr. pistorius ands' now withdrawn from the case. and he has some pending, a number of charges of attempted murder. there are all kind of drama played itself up during the the course of the week in the pretoria magistrate's court during the bail hearing. >> and so what, it will be interesting from a legal standpoint of the investigator is that from what i understandis that there's a huge risk that the crime scene was very contaminated and if it was contaminated that would necessarily be to the benefit of the accused if somehow this, this investigator had made a mess of the investigation going on. are you hearing that he's made a mess of the actual crime scene? >> we're hearing in fact the evidence during the bail hearing is that it was contaminated up to a point and there'll be further investigation as far as forensics are concerned. and all of these issues will be dealt with at the trial. oubl, the crime scene has been contaminated, that can affect the evidence, in fact, to such an extent that evidence obtained, forensically in the beginning, can be eventually exchewlude excluded. and that remains to be seen. my thought they appointed aninvestigating officer that should never have been appointed in the first place and should have been aware of the previous cases and pending cases against him and he put up a miserable performance during the bail hearing. and if you're going to impose bail you need to do so properly. >> greta: couple of quick questions. this will be a judge trial, right? you don't have juries? >> we don't have juries, this will be a judge trial, and they are legally qualified personals. >> greta: is the burden of proof on the prosecution and what's the standard? >> the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt. and it's on the prosecution at the trial different from what happened during the bail hearing where the onus or the burden rested on the-- on the court to release him. >> greta: it pretty much mirrors what we have in the united states. here we have a jury and candemand one or waive one. otherwise pretty much the same? >> yes, it's pretty much the same. the same kind of evidence is presented, cross examination, and i think other than the fact that a jury can in certain instances be allocated in the united states. everything else is fairly much the same in out africa. >> greta: william, thank you very much. >> great, thank you. nice chatting with you. >> greta: coming up, helpful hints from al-qaeda. no, it's not a joke. why is al-qaeda giving a list of tips and for whom are the tips. and also ryan seacrest has big news to share with his fans. is he getting married, having a baby or something else?

>> well, it's not exactly a high-tech response to drones, but it shows that al-qaeda isan adaptive organization, number one, that it recognizes this as a threat. and that it's taking steps to minimize that it may be excessively, excessive reliance that we placed on drones as a way of dealing with al-qaeda and number two the fact that it's distributed around the terrorist network shows how al-qaeda developed and metastasized around the world and a lie to the administration narrative that it's on the road to defeat because it doesn't have a meeting of a corporate al-qaeda board of directors doesn't mean the organization's not growing and spreading and remains a-- a larger threat than before. >> i think things have change dramatically. we've just signed-- the united states set up a drone base in africa and i think the nature of this whole war has changed dramatically and i'm surprised at this. >> well, i wish i believedthat as well. i think this drone base and this is a good idea, but i don't think that we have a broad strategy. the french have made the sweep through northern mali and they're now withdrawing and we'll see whether the al-qaeda elements, the other terrorists there simply return and take over that territory again. you can't treat these incidents, the attack in benghazi on december 11th, the hostage seizing in algeria as one off unrelated events and we need a broader strategy to deal with al-qaeda in various manifestation, in iraq and the arabian peninsula and i don't see any evidence that the administration is being serious about that or our european allies while we're on the subject. but i say that we've turned the corner or that there's a new chapter in this because drones can be armed or unarmed and we have them now and at some point down the road, others will have them and sometime, and they will be used then against us. >> yeah, i mean, it's clear that china's developing a veryhe advanced drone capability, but like any weapon, it's simply an instrument. it's not a policy in the clinton administration, their favored response to a problem was to launch some tomahawk cruise missiles, effective weapons and they don't resolve the problem and our unwillingness to confront the reality that al-qaeda is a threat and it's a threat worldwide and it's a growing threat cripples our ability to deal with it effectively. if we don't acknowledge the reality, it's no surprise that you can't respond to it. >> well, i have no idea where this is going, i just know that it's very different and we need a national dialog on this. >> absolutely right. >> and ambassador, thank you, sir. >> thank you. >> right now, the pakistani doctor who helped the cia track down osama bin laden remains in prison in pakistan and tonight, a call for hollywood to help. >> california activists askingoscar nominees from zero dark thirty and other films to put the spotlight on the doctor's plight. dominic di-natale has more from los angeles. nice to talk to you. >> reporter: great to talk to you, how are you doing. >> greta: very well. dominic, tell the viewers who the doctor is and what he did for the u.s.? >> the pakistani doctor who helped the cia verify the location of bin laden and his compound in pakistan. he basically ran a hepatitis vaccination program set up by the cia and went to the compound under the pretext of vaccinating. and the calls to the compound to set up the visits were copied or traced by the cia and they've got a voice print of bin laden's personalcourier and they knew they were on to the al-qaeda leader. >> and so our navy seals go in and take out usama bin laden and leave behind the doctor and he's arrested by the pakistanis, isi, thrown in prison and tried for treason and 30, 35 years. and have we done anything to get him back or to help free him? >> the efforts to get the doctor out have been very weak, quite frankly, on this side of the u.s. government, both at the cia level and also the state department in an effort-- in its efforts as well and one of the reasons, the u.s. government is very, very scared when it comes to dealing with the pakistanis, because they're so material, it's part of the pakistani military which is very controlling inside pakistan to send militants over to afghanistan to attack on soldiers and n.a.t.o. soldiers over there. so, washington is very concerned about actually upsetting pakistan, evenfurther. and you know, we give them up to 2 billion dollars a year in military aid and we're getting virtually nothing in return for that. he so, washington doesn't have to deal with this primarily and one of the reasons they haven't attacked the issue as much as you think they would. >> all right, so now some of the civilian americans are doing something with an ad. tell me about it. >> okay. this is a copy of the the ad. it ran in this week's hollywood reporter. it's the full page ad in the oscars special edition of the reporter and it's set up by a california philanthropist who basically was reading all our coverage, reading and listening to all of our coverage about the doctor and felt compelled to do something about it and he thought the air in which zero dark thirty about the bin laden rain was up for numerous awards and the people who made the film should be standing up and speaking about it, saying, hey, what about the doctor, in the movie, he'd been left behind. and the people who set up thiscampaign afridi is america's hero. and millions of people watching the oscar around the world and put the pressure on the u.s. government to get the man out and the world's terrorist, there would be no zero dark thirty without him. >> it's not just that he's in prison, he's being tortured is that right? >> that's right. his mistreatment has not ended at the hands of the isi. the pakistans that captured him and learned in the past 24 hours, he released a desperate plea to his family for some help to get him out. to get him out of the prison, because conditions are just getting considerably worse and he's fearful for his safety and that was communicated to the family in the past 24 hours, greta. >> thank you very much and i'm sure that a lot of our viewers are very interested in this,dr. afridi helped the united states immensely and now sitting in prison in pakistan. thank you, dominic. >> we do want to know what you think. will hollywood's help help get this doctor out of prison and should the united states do something?

the u.s. navy and los angeles police department. and he may also be armed to the hilt so how are s.w.a.t. teams going to find him. let's bring in rod wheeler, fox news contributor and former washington d.c. homicide detective and rod, this is a serious case as in any situation, but what's unique about this, is that this is one of lapd's, a former cop who knows inside-- the insides of how to operate tactically and how to be deceptive and intelligence. so how do you track a guy like that. >> you're exactly right. this guy has been very well-trained not only with the the l.a. police department, kelly, but also an a member of the navy. the navy reserves. so we know what we're up against and to be honest, this is one of the worst types of situations any police department can find themselves confronted with, when you haveto go after one of your own. so how will they in fact find this guy? here is what's going to have to happen, kelly. this guy is going to have to slip up at some point or he's just going to have to make a decision that he's going to engage the police in some type of a battle in which we probably anticipate he's going to want to do which is fine. he's going to lose that battle and now what? christopher dorner knows he's going to lose that battle so there also exists a possibility, kelly, that this guy may decide to become suicidal. >> kelly: and we're looking at his pictures right now, you can see that he was a captain so he was an enlisted guy, in the naval reserve when you look at a guy like this, you've got to figure what made him snap. apparently gone into a homicidal rage, killing three innocent people, injuring others and making a manifesto na appeared on facebook where he vows to do more even to the point of losing his own life because as he says, he hasnothing to lose. >> i'm not so sure this guy snapped all of a sudden. the reason i say that, more information, new information is starting to come out just today. i was just reading where if you look back at this guy's history, kelly, this guy made several complaints against the l.a. police department. not just one, he complained about several different officers and he also had some relationship issues with his girlfriend. so, what we're trying to do now is to try to create a profile of in guy, what makes this guy tick. where could his next step be and we have to try to anticipate where he may be so that we can try to intercept him. >> kelly: all right. ron, thank you for that, a former d.c. homicide detective and we've got to leave it there for now, but i know you'll keep us up-to-date what's going on in this case. >> yeah. >> kelly: we're going to leave it there and have some breaking news right now. learning that new york governor andrew cuomo is holding a news conference as we speak about the severe weather that new york and other states have encountered. let's listen right now.>> he's going to receive help from companies all across the state. and we are deploying several hundred plows to the area right now. i spoke with new york city mayor mike bloomberg about the city. and the city is in a stable condition, so, mayor bloomberg is also going to be sending resources to suffolk county and we thank you for that, and nassau county executive and the neighboring counties, going to be sending resources. he so there will be additional equipment and personnel en route to suffolk as we speak and equipment coming from other parts of the state, also. this state had consequences, but nothing like our neighboring states. the state of connecticut, the situation was worse and the situation in the state of massachusetts was much, much worse. i spoke to governor malloy of connecticut and governor duvalpatrick of massachusetts. we're in a position where we're going to be sending resources to both of those states. we'll send plow equipment personnel to connecticut and also massachusetts. we'll be also sending utility crews to connecticut and massachusetts. in terms of power outages, we have an issue in suffolk county, about 10,000 people are out of power and we have been working with the utility companies there and we'll be sending resources, but we can also send resources to connecticut and massachusetts and we'll be doing that and then they were hit much harder than the state of new york so we wish them well and i wish their governors well. i ask the people of the state to use consideration today, if you really don't need to leave the house for an urgent matter, don't leave the house. there are crews all over the state working to clear the roads. it becomes more complicated when people are on the roads and more complicated when a person comes out and getsstuck and now the plows have to worry about moving that car. >> jamie: all right, new york governor andrew cuomo giving an update and status, saying new york was hits, but not as hard as our neighbors, neighbors helping neighbors and resources from here will go to help massachusetts in particular, who's been very, very hard hit with as much as three feet of snow there. which is the perfect time for us to bring in peter judge, from the massachusetts emergency management agency. joining me now live on the phone. peter, how are you doing this morning? >> well, we're hanging in there right now. >> all right, and overnight, busy? >> very busy. we were basically dealing with a main issue, obviously, the power outages and right now, we've got about 400,000 folks without power and it's pretty well concentrated in a southeast part of the state right now. >> what's the biggest challenge today? >> well, actually, we're kind of going through our today's biggest challenge, a 10 a.m. high tide, as nomically high tide, so, a lot of our easterncoast has been, right now in the process of dealing with issues. we've got national guard up and down the coast who have been trying to evacuate people as many places, their homes are being kind of saturated. so, that certainly is our storm issue to deal with. the long-term issue is the safety of these folks without power because most of them don't have heat as well. so the quicker we can restore power, the quicker we can assure that these people are going to be safe. >> you know, one of the things i think we forget about when we see all the snow is that risk of flooding on the coast. you said astronomically high tide, the highest you've ever seen? >> no, this time of year highest one of the month anyway and then we've added you know, 30 foot waves off shore and probably like a three or four foot storm surge on top of that. so in that regard, you know, what were streets a littlewhile ago kind of look like canals in a lot of these towns up and down the coast. >> jamie: we were looking at pictures of interstate 290 and the snow is piled up to the bottom of the sign and the snow is continuing to come down. are you able to access all areas that you need to? and will the weekend be enough for cleanup? >> well, no. ultimately this is going to be a long struggle. the folks who have been able to access are the folks and national guard vehicles that can traverse some of the bad terrain out there. the governor actually had declared a travel ban yesterday at four o'clock, so the roads themselves have minimal traffic on them. so, it allows, obviously, the plows to do their job and also allows, the public safety vehicles and national guard vehicles to more easily get where they have to get to to help these folks out. >> did you find that people heeded the call? last night i was contributing reports and saying to people if you don't have what you need by now, don't go it. did they listen to you?>> absolutely, it was a ghosttown out there which was great. i think we had a total of 30 people on the entire state that ended up being sort of stranded, at least temporarily, no long-term issues, but basically who got stuck and had to-- had to be helped out. so, in that regard. people stayed home. they're continuing to stay home and the roads, major roads, even side roads are pretty wide open, allowing the plows to get their job done. >> that's great. i think that people forget it's not just about their safety, but letting the emergency crews get in to do what they need to do. before i let you go, you said about 400,000 people without power. when do you think it will be restored? >> well, the problem is, the utilities aren't going to let their crews go out it there to begin the restoration until after it's safe when the storm stops and we could be well into the late afternoon before the conditions are right that these folks can go out and get in the bucket trucks, rightnow, 30, 40 mile per hour winds out there. and could be a long haul. the good thing, the 400,000 are pretty condensed into one part of the state so i think a certified attack, you know, a group attack on these outages i think are going to work much bet are thter than if we have t state-wide. we heard that andrew cuomo that some resources from here will help folks out there. good luck, emergency management, thank you for taking time for us today. >> thank you very much for having me. >> jamie: take care, kelly. >> kelly: new concerns as the pentagon threatens to make big cuts, including pay cuts for our servicemen and women and what it it could mean for the strength of our military as outgoing secretary panetta says these cuts must be stopped. >> we've got to use this opportunity to express againmy greatest concern, as secretary, frankly, one of the greatest security risks we are now facing as a nation, that this budget uncertainty could prompt the most significant readiness, military readiness crisis in more than a decade. .

(crunch!) ♪music announcer: buy a new tracker proteam 175 and get a free gift card.>> since we are now just weeks away from deep automatic cuts to federal spending, including the fed, there's no reason for that to happen. putting our fiscal house in order calls for a balanced approach not massive indiscriminate cuts that could have a severe impact on our military preparedness. >> well, that was president obama yesterday speaking about massive looming defense budget cuts, as the pentagon threatens to reduce pay forour men and women in uniform and other painful money saving measures and all of that is raising questions about u.s. military strength down the road. now, new polls show americans are concerned. nearly half of our country believes the u.s. is weaker than less powerful than five years ago and less than one quarter think that america is stronger. a retired major general, fox news military analyst. >> good morning, jamie. >> jamie: i don't have to tell you how much i appreciate our troops, they're the greatest and the best. how much will cuts impact readiness. >> and the army cuts the o and m, operation and training budget, some 78% and also means a pay cut for our young men and women, and probably most dangerous, it threatens the contact that the american people have with their soldiers who have gone through what, now, over a decade ofvery, very painful wars, repeated trips to afghanistan and iraq. great stress on the families and now, these young soldiers are looking at the prospect of being thrown out of the military, without any proper preparation or any proper forethought on the part of the department. now, i've seen this happen three times in my lifetime, jamie, after vietnam, you recall the peace in the '90s carters hollow military, but i've never seen anything in my years as dangerous as this sequestration process, jamie. >> jamie: what is the possible outcome that you feel is so dangerous, what's the worst case scenario? >> you know, soldiers will understand this. probably the most delicate, difficult thing you can maintain in the military is a training edge. if soldiers don't train, if pilots don't fly, ships don't sail every day, then they falloff, the efficiency falloff curve is very, very steep. and you go a year without training small units or flying aircraft, then all of that great experience that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, have earned over the last ten years will literally dissipate. not in years, but in months and weeks, so if we cut training and if our soldiers begin to leave the ranks and vote with their feet and our units begin to fall pay part because the soldiers are not being trained and not allowed to exercise in the field, the long-term consequences for the nation would be catastrophic. >> general, when -- and i follow this obviously. when i hear like the u.s.s. truman which was to deploy to the persian gulf can't go now because we can only afford to have one ship in the region, what message does that send to the countries there that, i mean, i'll be blunt. they hate us. >> well, it's veryinteresting, i'm sure the iranians are sitting around a table somewhere in tehran changing their military policy based on what they perceive as emerging military weakness, look, this is so important, jamie, in my opinion, that if she is sequestration cuts continue, the united states is going to have to relook at the entire national security policy. look, work college 101, it's about ends and means. if you cut the ends of the resources by 70, 80% we can't have the same national strategy to your point. we can't have two carriers in the middle east and one in the pacific. we can't afford to have a-- the deployment model for the army and the marine corps. we can't put our aircraft in the air. if we can't do that. then we're going to have to change our fundamental approach to national defense, jamie. >> before i let you go with all of that insight and information, general, president obama's message to congress is listen to leon panetta, who has obviouslybeen a public servant, don't make these cuts. work out a resolution, what's your message to our congressional members on this? >> you know, i guess my message would be very simple, the american people and congress and the administration have a compact with our young men and women. they've done their job. some of these young nco's have had 4, 5, 6, 7 rotations to iraq and afghanistan. don't wait until we wind down to change the character of the contract with the soldiers and marines. that would not only weaken our defense, in my opinion it would be morally wrong. >> jamie: got it, general, general bob scales, always a privilege to have you here. >> thank you, jamie. >> kelly: some sobering thoughts there from the general. meantime, we're keeping our eye on the monster snowstorm pounding the northeast. some areas already seeing more than two feet of snow andforecasters warn there's more to come, wow. plus, new efforts to help you eat healthy could come with a huge price tag. a look at the f.d.a.'s proposal for grocery stores and what it could mean for business owners and customers like you.

she is safe. her abductor, james dimaggio is dead. killed we believe in an f.b.i. shootout at a camp siet in remote wilderness in idaho. this taking place in the last hour and a half. san diego's sheriff department saying there was a confrontation between f.b.i. officers who moved inafter he was spotted at a campsite he had made with himself. we don't know whether it was a drone or helicopter. there was a confrontation. there was a shootout and hannah managed to survive. right now she is being taken to a hospital to be inspected to see if she is okay. her father who was very concerned about her appeal to dimaggio to let her go. they will probably be reunited in the morning. moments from now we are expecting a press conference from the f.b.i. and valley county sheriff's department to explain how the tactical operation played out. we'll have details hopefully how dimaggio died but the best news is that hannah is safe. this goes back a week when her mother and brother were killed at the house. he abducted hannah who we believe had a long obsession with and vanished for threedays. his car was found nearby close to the camping site where they were found. 150 f.b.i. officers and local enforcement going through the wilderness on foot and horseback. finally they were spotted today. hannah was found safe. we'll have more details, back to you. >> judge jeanine: thanks so much for that. we hope to be back with you. on the phone right now, we have brett anderson, hannah's father joins us. brett, are you there? >> yes, i am. >> judge jeanine: i feel terrific. i can't imagine how you feel. talk us? >> i have very mixed emotions. i'm ecstatic that my daughter, we will be reunited. i'm still saddened for my wife and son. i'm worried about what my daughter has been put through.i'm very mix of emotions. >> judge jeanine: do we know whether or not hannah is aware of the fact that her mother and brother are dead? >> i am not aware of that yet. that is something hopefully i'll know more about tomorrow and the detectives are looking into that. i want to say something to everybody out there. i am a big advocate of the amber alerts going out nationwide. obviously it helps make a difference and hopefully it will make a difference in a lot more cases. >> judge jeanine: you had an opportunity to see hannah, do you know what condition she is in? is she physically okay? >> all i've heard she appeared to be in good condition that she was going to be taken to be checked out. i have not see her until i arrive where i'm going.>> judge jeanine: i assume that you will see her soon. how do you feel about the fact that dimaggio is dead and the fact that your daughter survived? did you ever think that was going to be a possibility in light of the fact that your wife and son were murdered? >> you know, i feel like i have won the lottery. i have no concern and i am worried about my daughter. >> judge jeanine: the thoughts of all of us are with you brett. we certainly agree with you the amber alert is something extremely important for the safety and for the protection of young children. is there anything else that you can tell us that we are not aware of since this is breaking now? >> i only know as much as you do right now. my thoughts are getting ready to go see my daughter. you know, kudos to law enforcement.they just did an excellent job and i can never so my appreciation enough to anybody out there that showed us love and support. i love you guys. >> judge jeanine: all right. law enforcement always working quietly behind the scenes. this appears to have been jointed effort by the f.b.i. and local police. there were talk have drones as well as infrared activity to locate this guy dimaggio in an area where there was hundreds of miles of trails. the largest apparently roadless area in the lower 48 states. black bears, wolves all present in that area. brett, are you able to stay with us? >> not much longer. i've got a lot to prepare and get ready here. >> judge jeanine: let me just ask you one more question about hannah. is he is the kind, does shehave the strength and the ability to be able to look back at this and hopefully at some point put it behind her? >> you know, all we can do is hope and pray. we don't know what she has been through. she is a strong girl. she made it this far. all we can do is hope that whatever help she needs to get through this, we show the love and support and help her through. >> judge jeanine: what do you think you'll say to her when you see her? >> that i love her. >> judge jeanine: all right. thanks so much for that. brett anderson, the father of hannah anderson who is alive and is apparently been taken to a hospital. james dimaggio is dead reportedly in a shootout with the f.b.i. and local police in an area i believe in idaho which was an areawhere apparently the largest roadless area in the lower 48 states. it's an amazing recovery of this young girl who has been through so much. her mother murdered, her brother murdered. her taken into this area by dimaggio who apparently was obsessed with her and is now dead. in any event we will have more as the evening goes on. andrew is joining us now. he is a friend of dimaggio. he joins us from los angeles. now andrew, you were scheduled to be on the show to talk about dimaggio. now you just heard that your friend is dead. so, tell us what your emotions are right now. >> first of all, i spoke to laura, jim's sister, the family wishes to expresstheir condolences for all the tragedy that has happened so far. right now, we're asking that they be left alone and people go through me. >> judge jeanine: let's talk about you and james dimaggio. did you ever expect this kind of thing could happen? >> yes, i've been express go to the media two nights ago it was my belief he was reacting to the suicide of his father of 15 years ago. the fact that he burned his house down on the anniversary date of his father's disappearance 15 years ago and the fact that i predicted he would kill himself or be killed today. >> judge jeanine: andrew, do we know why his father committed suicide? was there an episode that triggered that.>> his father had a long history, troubled history. he was in and out of jail. he had a crystal pseudoephedrine addiction and he took a large. methamphetamine and walked into the desert and committed suicide. >> judge jeanine: why do you feel that james dimaggio. why is it the 15th anniversary has some significance as opposed to the tenth or the fifth? >> you know i'm not only jim's friend. i've been involved in psychiatric work for 22 years. i had two psychiatric corporations and run clean treatment centers. in working with laura and the family, i discovered these dates. i announced to the f.b.i. it was clear to me that itfell into the pattern what we often see that have a suicidal plan. often when people are suicidal and depressed they will make a plan how they commit suicide. we ask people that we think are suicidal do you have a plan. >> judge jeanine: did you ask him about that? >> i never had a chance to. i was hoping there would be a chance to completely verify my suspicions. it does appear that all coincides with the dates. >> judge jeanine: did james ever speak to you about an obsession he had for 16-year-old hannah who has been rescued and now at a hospital? did he talk about her? >> he never spoke to any family member, neither laura, her husband or myself about any obsession with hannah. there was never any signeven mr. anderson expected he didn't see any warning signs of this coming. if there had we would have intervened. >> judge jeanine: but you as a confident someone with a psychiatric background, no indication that he had any feelings for hannah? how often did you talk with him? >> i must have spoke to him indirectly through barry and barry i spoke at length who is -- barry said the conversation we were planning another camping trip in the next few months. the conversations were pretty much normal. only things we had any indication where he is, there had been a discussion he had been smoking marijuana recently and that was troubling.>> judge jeanine: have you seen him with a girlfriend recently. has he talked about women? >> yeah, he had girlfriends but he came from very traumatic family background. mother died of cancer. he left training for submarine work with the navy. then he went off and took and never dealt with these issues. >> judge jeanine: you know what, he should have dealt with the issues instead of murdering and traumatizing people. >> i couldn't agree more. >> judge jeanine: coming up more on the dramatic rescue of hannah anderson. later a fox interview with the bus driver from this shocking

>> and surely finding osama bin laden and surely passing civil rights legislation and defeating the nazis was much more formidable than taking on the gun lobby. >> jon: and america's great debate giving the topic a lot of attention. but is the dehe baitone-sided. >> i've seen the most beautiful girl i've ever met. she was just that person that i turn to. >> jon: a tear jerking story that got big attention in the media. even more when it turned out to be a hoax. how did reporters miss this one? ""the washington post"" makes news caught in another plagerism scandal. mr. obama holds the last news conference of his first term and takes a shot at the media for the anger in washington and on the topic of doping, lance comes clean on oprah, will it help his cause or her floundering career? >> here we are in austin, texas. >> jon: on the panel, writer and fox news contributor, judy miller, and jim pinkerton and cal thomas and kirsten powers, i'm jon scott, fox news watch is on right now.>> this will be difficult. there will be pundits and politicians and special interest public lobbyists, publicly warning of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty, not because that's true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue for themselves and behind the scenes they'll do everything they can to block any common sense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever. >> jon: president obama on wednesday flanked by his vice-president and four children with their parents, pushing his agenda on gun control, taking a swipe at his opponents and the media in lock step with his efforts. >> surely finding osama bin laden, surely passing civil rights legislation as lyndon johnson was able to do and before that, surely defeating the nazis was a much moreformidable task than taking on the gun lobby. >> so if we can defeat the germans in world war ii, i guess the n.r.a. is supposed to be-- is that what he's saying? >> right, he's giving himself a little bit of wiggle room. i didn't exactly compare the nra to the nazis, stew $them in the same spot and let the audience sort it out. we're sure to see, on gun owners opponents of gun control and language when you see words like nazis. george orwell in 1946 a famous essay, the word fascism should only be used for people with hitler and-- that was 1946, 70 years later we're still doing it. >> jon: do you see it differently, judy? >> not really, i thought that schieffer was very close to the line of advocacy as opposed to reading the news and being straight about a news story.i do think that even though there was no direct comparison there's clearly an inference that the n.r.a. is equivalent to the nazis and raises questions whether or not he wasn't just a little too opinionat opinionated. >> jon: if the president said there would be outrageous claims ginning up fear among gun owners. >> yeah. >> jon: or among the population. >> i do think that a lot of people-- speaking of nazis, a lot of people, gun rights people think that obama is the next hitler and they need guns to protect themselves from his tyranny and i can't stand the p.c. stuff, it drives me crazy. and seinfeld had the soup nazi and now when you say it everyone thinks they're comparing them to gassing people and murdering 6 million jews. i think that what bob schieffer's point was if we can overcome such huge things,certainly, obama should be able to stand up to the nra. the nra owns congress and-- >> nra is-- >> what does it matter, also the civil rights act, could pass a civil rights act, surely you could stand up to the nra. i don't think he was comparing anybody to hitler. i think any more than he was comparing them to passing the civil rights legislation thing. difficult thing, difficult thing, but this is actually less difficult than these things over here. >> jon: there was a lot of polling out this week, cal, not often noticed among it was the gallup poll approval of the n.r.a. and the president. >> the media always turned to government as a first resource instead of a last resort. we have more laws on the books regarding guns than ever now, especially in chicago where over 500 people were murdered in 2012. why isn't the president out there in chicago? the answer is not more legislation, it ends up in thehomes of fatherless children and the media there's no republican they can turn into the devil, are now going after the nra. they never talk about the law abide be citizens of the country who are not breaking the law and the more laws you pass are not upon people who want to break the law to suddenly become law abiding. >> jon: what about the theaterics at that news conference, putting those kids on the stage behind him. rich lawrie, an occasional guest on this program wrote in the national review, barack obama set a new standard for stupidly exploittative white house events. >> i think that's really an unfair criticism. it was children who were killed at sandy hook, and it was children who had written to the president saying this is what we can do, can you do something? it was an emotional pitch, yes, it was against an organization as kirsten says owns the congress and i think it's fair game. >> jon: the l.a. times, jim called the president's production, big, bold andbrassy. >> right. of course, if it had been under reagan or bush 41 or 43 they would have called it deferesque, as in mike defer, would have said it was-- the showmanship and pageantry here part of television chug television news and can't complain about it too much, but it's situational when it's good when democrats do it, bad when republicans do it. >> jon: and then the nra ad that came out this week, and t the-- it blasts nbc news anchor david gregory as being sort of elitist and a hypocrite. what do you think, kirsten? >> well, i mean, the ad probably -- they're trying to this take approach anybody who wants to have gun laws is elitist, and it's a false paradigm that the nra is setting up. they need a new pr director, just for starters, because they're not doing a good job communicating their view. it's not elitism. people have different views about gbs and people havedifferent views of whether you need to have a weapon that can fire 60 rounds in a minute or not. whatever you call it. getting the terminology right isn't the point. the point is that there are a lot of americans who think you don't need to have that.      what can we do with a brand new year, and a room that needs refreshing? we can work with a new collection of carpet that proves durable can be softer than ever. we can get for less and spread that softness even further. turns out, we can do even more than we thought we could. because this is the year of doing. more saving. more doing. that's the power of the home depot. ll out the new year with % off or 24 months special financing with your home depot credit card.that's the sound of car insurance compani these days. here a cheap, there a cheap, everywhere a cheap... you get it. so, what if instead of just a cheap choice, you could make a smart choice? like, esurance for example.they were born online and built to save people money from the beginning. it's what they've always done. not just something they cheap about. that's insurance for the modern world. esurance. now backed by allstate. click or call. >> i've seen the most beautiful girl i have ever met. not just for his physical beauty, but for the beauty of her character and who she is she was just that person that i turned to and even though she was fighting leukemia and you know, fighting various things she always found time to serve someone else and her biggest thing to me was always, always be humble, always be humble and keep god as my number one closest friend and as long as i strive to honor him, i'll be honoring her. and her whole thing was notabout herself, and that's why we were so close. >> jon: oh, boy, notre dame's star linebacker manti te'o, got all kinds of media attention, and his performance on the field and personal story getting him on the cover of sports illustrated, high profile coverage from other media outlets. all of that attention changed in tone once the website deadspin revealed the girlfriend never existed. the whole story was a hoax. so, did the mainstream media fail here, judy? >> well, i'm sorry, but this falls into, i know the journalism lesson if your mother says she loves you, check it out. but you would really have to be an awfully skeptical person to assume that this man's girlfriend did not exist. i don't think it would occur to a lot of editors to asktheir reporters is this so. >> jon: you're a reporter for a long time, did the press get bamboozled here? >> i want to confess to my longstanding relationship with tinker bell. look, it's called a telephone, you pick it up, you call if the person is in the hospital, call the pr person, do you have somebody who is is a patient in your hospital, by this name or can i talk to her, i'm the whatever, you look at the obit page if they've died. there are all kind of ways to check out this information, another one of those too good to be true things. >> jon: isn't that part of what happened here? the media wanted to believe the story. >> i'm sure they did, but i think a basic ask for an obituary and i'm surprised they didn't ask a for a picture of them together. if you're going to run a story, notice he said in that interview, when we met. which he's also said in interviews described how he met her, i'm not even buying the fact that he's been duped. >> right, because it's beenunclear about that. he indicated when the story broke that he had been duped by some nefarious people. >> right. >> jon: here is the the way the new york times put it. i could never imagining editing such a story, from joe secti sexton, asking them, did you know for a fact his grandmother is dead. do you know for a fact his girlfriend is dead, do you know for a fact that his grandmother existed or girlfriend existed. and anyone who tells you they would, questions is kidding you. and not one reporter did the-- the lack of leg work is a total surprise to me. >> having seen the press's adulation for lance armstrong and tiger woods, not only is the press, the sorry too good, but the machine of money andwealth. not only do people get rich endorsings things as athletes, but the reporters who are experts on them get rich being expert commenttators on the person. the last thing the people doing the file in sports illustrated was tear him down. if he went of, they would have gone with them. >> i have to totally disagree. at usa today we have fact checkers, when i write a column, there is a fact checker, a person goes through my column and asks me, i have to footnote everything that i say, no way on earth i could say somebody has died without any any sort of-- >> and maybe a better standards and sports illustrated. >> one speculation, staffs are cut back all over the country and not enough people, but if you've got one person in an office that can pick up the telephone and fact check. >> and also google. >> he speaking of fact checking, ""the washington post"" got caught in a bit of plagiarism this week, a reporter named william booth, is that, do i have the name right, william booth admittedlifting some sentences from an academic journal. judy? >> i think that in an era of cut and paste journalism where we often times do our research, we don't have those researchers anymore, we do our own, and you take material from one journal and put it on a screen, you sometimes forget to attribute. i want to give the reporter the benefit of the doubt on this one. >> i agree with that. >> jon: and what did we learn from the president's press conference this week? >> mr. obama gives the press another chance to ask tough questions, did they hit him hard? and inauguration day is here, will the media love fest continue? .>> what chuck and i and many people are curious about this new adamant desire to not negotiate that seems to conflict with the modern era of presidents and the history of the debt ceiling and your own history with the debt ceiling and doesn't that suggest we're going into a default because no one is talking to each other how to resolve this? >> no, major, i think if you look at the history, getting votes for the debt ceiling is always difficult. >> jon: president obama a little testy there answering a question from cbs news white house correspondent major garrett, formerly of this network. it was mr. obama's final news conference of his first term. so, what did you think, judy, about the questions that the president received? only seven of them for a news conference. the answers went on very long. >> you might even say stonewalling answers, each answer was roughly the equivalent of about seven anda half minutes. no wonder there's no time for follow-ups. look, the white house press corps, how many times do we have to talk about it. other than major garrett, who was a sight to see there, even jake tapper said, oh, yes, major always asks good questions, when he was on fox we didn't call on him much. that's what this is about. the white house press corps has to be more skeptical. >> and partially a technical plight. one way he filibusters or runs out the clock, change the way the mic would be, they used to be shotgun mics and now they pass down the aisle, it looks like a high school deal and you don't get the follow-up questions. two or three follow-ups you didn't hear and only heard the president's answers. >> and university of minnesota put together a piece, fox still shunned at fox press conferences, a smart analysis, says that abc reporters calledon the most frequently followed by cbs, associated press and nbc with fox news coming in at a distant 9th in less than half of the rates of the top outlets, less than 40% of the press conferences overall. why does the president not like to call on them? >> because he doesn't want to be embarrassed, really. because when he's asked a question, the same way, you know, when ed henry asks questions in the-- jay carney, inevitably jay carney ends up looking stupid because he doesn't know how to answer the question and use today pushing people around and you know, it will be tenacious and get asked about something he doesn't want to get asked about and he wants softballs. >> jon: story to interrupt you, after that press conferences washington post gave mr. obama a rare upside down pinochio. >> that's a brave voice, if you deal with those kinds of criticisms with the liberal mainstream media then ofcourse the answers are seven or eight minutes long and you don't want many questions, but as fred barnes wrote in the weekly standard, a four year press honeymoon and now looks like it will be an eight year press honeymoon. >> jon: we've got the inauguration coming on monday, and judy is rolling her eyes as i phrase the question. how is that going to be covered? can you see the headlines now? >> i think we're going to have more of the same. i think what disturbs some of us is the double standard, if this president does something, if he kills people from 300 feet with a drone, if he draws up lists of americans who can be killed, it's fine, nobody says anything. if george bush did it,ed world would be coming to an end. >> water boarding was evil, >> water boarding was evil, but killing them m m m m years ago, my doctor told me to take a centrum silver multivitamin every day. i told him, sure. can't hurt, right?

to attack out its own citizens. and the pentagon sending a message. the top brass suggesting that the u.s. military is ready to act on a moment's notice in syria. >> and remembering the day when the martin luther king juniorhad a dream. it is a half century later. and tonight, following the to the steps of a civil moment in american history. and also former vice-president cheney speaking loud and clear on the national issues which are front and center on the minds of many americans. >> don't put the nsa with the irs. they are totally different problems and issues and i believe there is ample evidence that the irs abused the player and daughter liz a political candidate. words from the father/daughter duomaking headlines. >> i am harris faulkner. how will the united states respond to the crisis in syria that has millions of people pouring over the borders trying to escape the slaughter house that their country has become.it could create now havens for terrorist and american national security time talked about the next step and talked about what is unfolding, pictures that are so hard to look at and impossible to aunticate and seem to go along with chemical attacks in syria. and more on the high level meeting for you. and first a deadly game of back and forth played out at this houred in of syria. they are accusing the anti- government rebels of using chemical weapons and others call that a thinly veiled attempt from the nerve gas assault on a neighborhood they say. defense secretary chuck hagel asked the pentagon to prepare military options for syria and that requires posiinging our forces. we know a fourth warm ship armed with ballistic missiles has beenis not to the mediterranean sea. and the chief is there to urge the syrian government to allow united nation's experts to look at chemical weapons attacks. aid groups said throw 55 people were killed and some have the number much higher and if confirmed it would be the wofrsous of chemical weapons since saddam hussein gassed curds. the civil war and estimates put it at more than 100,000. a yearing on president obama said chemical weapon used in syria would be crossing a red line. >> president conferred with another world leader on syria. >> he spoke with british prime minister david cameron about the possible chemical weaponsattack. they expressed grave concern and agreed to work together and with the international community to figure out how to respond. president obama is getting reports from the u.s. enteleigence community which according to the white white trying to ascertain what happened in syria and waiting to hear from a united nation's team in syria before the president makes a decision on how the u.s. will respond. in the moan time defense secretary chuck hagel told reporters that the defense department has a responsibility to provide the president with options for all contingency and that requires positioningur forces and assets to be able for the president to choose. and harris, the u.s. has four war ships in the region, harris. >> it is awfully difficult when we are not begin information or notes to know whether and this is a question, does this meanmilitary actions more or less likely at this point? >> it certainly gives president obama more flexibility to order air strikes or missile attacks if he decides to do. that one former un ambassador said president obama has to decide the objectives with syria and its government and stock poil of chemical weapons. >> the president said himself a year ago that the use of chemical weapons would cross a redline and when the president of the united states makes a statement like that, he needs to be prepared to do manage dramatic if the redline is crossed. otherwise his credibility is gravely damaged and that's where we are at the moment. >> but bolton believes that the administration will try to indict the syrian regime in the international criminal court. >> molly, on the story on which we have seen movement so much. coming up inside of the foxreport retired four star general and jack king will join us. my first question will be what we learned from molly. what is a serious response likely to look like? . well, it has been called one of the most important days in american history. today in washington, people gaggering to commemorate 50 years since martin luther king's i have a dream spoech coming a day shy of his speech. >> this is not the time for a nostollingic commemoration or self congratulatory celebration, the task is not done. the journey is not complete. we can and we must do more. >> today's event concluding with a half mile walk from the lincoln memorial to thetwo-year-old stat u that honors dr. martin luther king junior. we can see doug mcelway from the nation's capitol. your comments on the route. >> it was spectacular harris. it was aided from mother nature. it is not every day in late august she turns out a sun drenched low humidity and cool coined of day. that's what we had today. the late dr. martin luther king would be proud of the spirit of nonviolence and generalized good will. for me the most powerful moments came not from the podium but from the people in the crowd some of whom were here to watch that speech in known 63, and lived to tell about it and many others who watched it on television and still others who live in the seggated south like the brothers who grew up inmobile, obama. >> it was rough. segregation was alive and well. and it was hard for black people to stick together to achieve things, because of the violation. the bombing in birmingham and meg areas and all of the things were going on and so your parents were reluctant to have you participate because they knew the consequences. >> there is a lot of work in progress and up to us as the baby bomers and to pass on to my great nephews and being part of the movement and action and to volunteer and help your fellowman. >> we found one marcher who is 94 years old and marched in the 1963 event. he had the same sign he carried in known 63 and here he was imparting advice in a feisty wayto the young folks around him. >> the question is not what i think, it is what you people think? what are you going to do about it? answer me, what are you going to do approximate it? >> he told us that he was a truck driver and had a route from new york to washington and ran home and tock a bath and came down to the march. what a man. >> you described a family atmosphere, similar or contrasting to the original march? >> i think it was a huge contrast to the original march. washington on that particular day was a tense city. i grew up here and i was nine years old on that day and washington was a segregated town. i can remember talking to my friends were there going to be riots and people coming to the neighborhood and the adults were afraid. it was a reflection of what thefederal government was doing. the police force was on full alert and all hands on deck and national guard was called ought and fbi director hoover had infilm traited the movement and found communism activity and kennedy refused to meet with them because of a fear of imposing on him. and one out and the rest is history, harris. >> for our vowers. you have done a great job showing your perspective and putting things in context in the memories on the channel today. >> thank you, harris. >> right now, a wildfires is posing a threat to san francisco. the west is getting eaten up. a city roughly 150 mile per hour and why these flames couldaffect hundreds of thousands of

smoke warnings led to event cancellations. andom nick is live for us in california tonight. san francisco facing power and water out ages? >> that is right. it sounds astonishing considering it is 150 milesaway. you have a rez vorthat provides san francisco with 85 percent of its water. the fire is close to that. and that is threatening the water pipes that are up above the ground. if it gets that close it could destruct the water supply. and we have had wooden polls down. and it will cause disruption in the nor future. they are not saying how bad it would be. it is likely and the situation is out of the authority's control. >> i was reading earlier. you guys are part of the story because where you are is particularly vulnerability. we are in the city of toulumne east of where the fire is happening. 2,004 fires are brought in toprotect hundreds of homes and the town. it looks like the weather is great but it is heating up and it is making the fire worst. the windows will go up to 45 miles per hour and it will rocket it to the fej of the town. with the winds that strong containment lines can lope and anything over ten mile per hour is going to clean beyond the containment zone and why they are dedicating those assets. 4,004 fights dealing with the rim fire. >> it is something you said. that is a lot of people to move and evacuate and city of san francisco might not have utilities, where do you put everybody? >> everybody here is under advisory evacuation. some have gone to family elsewhere in the area. but when it comes to sanfrancisco, people will have to sit out the rolling outages and water. it could take days or weeks. putting the fire out alone. fire officials will not get on top of it until mid week and that would be the turning point and could be months before they can chlor the area. >> we hope for the best. he mentioned the forecast. 40 miles per hour windows. it is getting hotter. we'll check in with jana dean. >> the whole west is on fire as we look at the fire danger map. a lot of those fires burned up in california and id a ho. there is the rim fire wheredom nick is. and five percent containment. winds will pick up some cases 20 or 30 miles per hour. and temperatures will coloff and then on sunday a warm day on tap and winds gusting 25 or 30 miles per hour. the fires are so large they cancreate their own weather systems and winds.

thunderstorms could have light nipping and spark more wildfires danger and threat of severe weather. we are watching a tropical storm in the pacific that will bring much needed moisture in the

>> i think we can determine.it the president spoke by the experience his predecessor over the wmd in iraq and lack of inaccurate will bow to the un to do what they can do. assad can push back on the un the way saddam hussein hussein did. the way to get the verification is the doctors and others treating the patients know what it is by now and any doctor looking at the videos also knows. we know it is a chemical attack taking place. who did it is the issue then? we have intelligence services on the ground. they should be given the mission to go and do an investigation to get at the rockets that were fired and where were they fired from and witnesses to see that. you can't four rockets in a neighborhood and not have the people provide testimony. it is discernible rather quickly. >> i want to be able to read from a statement that isa freedom freedom in canada and also from the prime freedom in the uk. in this meeting with the president shortly after phone calls were made and other countries are being talked to. can we put words on the screen. serious response are being talked about this from the britain prime minister and significant use of chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international community and both have asked officials to examine all of the options. what would that look like exactly? >> in terms of our options, harris? >> right. >> certainly. let's get inside of assad's head. he's using chemical weapons against a neighborhood in eastern damascus because the rebels seized the neighborhood for a number of weeks and despite air power and military he is unsuccessful in dislodging them and he used the chemicalweapons and he has reasoned begin his introduction of chemical weapon in the past and no reaction to it, that number one, the united states will probably not act and number two, if the united states does act, i believe that assad's calculation believes it will be a statement attack designed to restore presidential credibility than an attack on a significant military capability that is destroyed or reduced dramatically. that is his head and what he's thinking about. >> general, what i know you said in the past. there is a big difference tone a statement attack and what you think is really necessary here. what is that differ? >> it is dramatic. options available to us is seize and secower chemical storage. we have to take the integrated air defense to fly our air in there. and we would not do that underthe circumstance. and secondly what is available to us. and more likely is to stand off in the med terrannian and surface ship submarine and used precision guyeded ammunition in syria that will be of value to him. i believe we should use this opportunity not to make a statement attack but eliminate and degrade one of his major capabilities and the first one he values is air power. this is six major air fields and take the infrastructure down and ammunition and airplane them and creator the run away. and we have to destroy the infrastructure and command and control for sometime he will not be able to use air power and that is something he is not expecting to help him frankly.>> when we have gone down the road before. we see mission creep. where we go in with a mission and kroep away and next thing you know, we are there two years. how do we get in and out and what is the mission? >> there is no entertaining the thought of being on the ground with our troops is where you get in mission creeps and more mission and challenges. >> you don't see us going in from the ground at all. just from the air. >> we have intelligence services on the ground and any conflict of interest and no, we'll not put anybody in the ground. it would be cruise and tomahawk and stand off. we would not have to take out the integrated air system. we may shoot at the batteries and be virtually vulnerable to the air system and the success of what we are doing would be high. and listen, harris, this is thesweet spot of the united states military capability and we know how to do it very well and we have done it in the past. we can absolutely render a significant blow to him if we choose to do that using his chemical weapons as a reason for it. >> we shouldn't be in this position right now. if they cross the redline by using chemical weapons which we have reports and pictures previously and we didn't do anything after that threat and you say we didn't hold a strong line then? >> you know, it is so frustrating to watch this happen. we have had multiple presidents from world war ii on develop the huge stat urt of the united states in the world and in terms of credibility and trust and we make a something that is going to happen because this is the united states and we aresquandering it to people openly talk about the united states being feckless and they have lost their will et cetera. and so clearly we should have acted before in my judgment. and i think we probably will act now because there is consensus in the international community and the president and international community to participate on this. i just hope we do something military siing can and not just a statement attack. >> before i let you go. the pentagon is putting those in the region and millions of people are moving across the border there. in fact, the number of syrian refugee children is at 1 million. i am wondering what can we do about the people caught in the middle? is that part of our mission, too? >> onlyectively way to deal with the problem is to change themomentum in favor of the rebels so the regime can topple and we provide the ashes assistance that is necessary. we have hundred thousand and if we let it go on. it will go on to 200,000 and multimillions of people displaced from their homes which is 2 million now and it will triple and also millions that will be refugees in a horrific situation that is. and the pressure on jord an and turkey it is significant if we continue to let it unfold the way assad wants it to unfold. i can authtenticate you are the real deal. we are grateful for your experience. always good to talk to you, harris. >> a matter of national security, it does not appear that way.employees that national security agency used the federal agencies enormous power of surveillance to spy on their lovers. the agency said such activity is very rare mostly involving overseas communication and partner and spouses that they are looking out for and most incidents were self reported and they got caught and went forward first. haft week the nsa confessed to violating privacy rules thens of times a year. in a prison riot. the wrong people armed. look at what the inmates had in their possession and it was deadly. this is in spain and spanish tradition making a american debut. running of the bulls right here in the united states. whoo hoo. clearance event the dodge way?

are you? >> fine, thank you. good to see you. >> 42% approval rating. 74% of americans think the american people are too dependent on government. what does that say? >> the american people are schizophrenic on this, they always say zboft too big. then you talk about what you're going to cut. no. no. don't cut that. one exception is obama care. and that is why stopping amnesty is important that remains the most important issue if amnesty goes through obama care will not be overturned. hispanics support obama care so please do not take your eye off the ball because obama care already passed in the senate they're trying to flip it through by not talking about it.politicians know as soon as we talk about it people will write and call and tell us we don't want obama care. as long as they don't say anything, we can slip it through the dark of night and republican contributors, you know, and mark zuckerbergs are going to give us money and screw the people who hate amnesty. as for this looming government shut down i've been listening to you talk about it on the radio along with other 14 million listeners and i have been dying to talk to you about this because i really don't think republicans should be on either side saying the other side is a monster or doing something horribly wrong. we all want to defund obama care. one side, i understand says had is going hurt us. we're not going to defund it. we have one half of one third of government. last time we tried this in the 90s it did hurt republicans a lot. i think three differents are different this time.one is that this time we have ted cruise and mike lee leading the fight. last time it was newt gingrich that ended up not being helpful. >> sean: the interview didn't hurt that much. >> it hurt a lot. point two every time the republicans threatened to shut down the government or shut down the government it's been over the budget generally. the deficit. i promise you, no one care btz deficit. republicans have been working on the deficit 30 years and lost every election. obama care is different. it's hitting now. look. teamsters may campaign with ted cruise because they want to stop this, it's after this irs scandal. and don't just say we want to put off implementation of this, if it comes to it say we're going to continue to fund the government.for a temporary period. this is a budget. >> because ann koumter trying to bring two sides snogt. >> not two sides. it's not reckless lunatics on another side. >> the tea party conservatives in this country which is a big part of the republican coalition want a fight. they want these guys to stand for something. >> they're with b.to give away the entire country. >> sean: it's with yes, about amnesty and about obama care this is their last chance. >> i no longer believe that. >> sean: why not? >> because people hate obama care. >> sean: name one big government program that has been in place then removed. >> this is why i worked hard to get mitt romney elected myfeeling if it was not, koit not be. i think it's a different country now. people do not like what's happening. the memory of what it was like getting health care for not through the department of motor vehicles is fresh in peoples minds we do have republicans in there. and i mean, just the outrageousness of finding out this week that senators and staff would not be subject to obama care? >> sean: you've got to love they've got some real cajones there. they do. >> yes. both sides want to defund obama care trying to figure out the best way to do it. i happen to think they should stage this fight. >> sean: how do you want this fight? this is key. how do you stage this fight? i like what cruise is saying. >> i have a third point. very, very important to get democrats on the record in another vote right now going into 2013 for obama care.this bill to be passed any sleazy way with 100 democrat votes wout a single republican vote. let's get senator prior from arkansas get them on the record voting to turn over to the irs in the middle of this scandal all of our health care. get the democrats on the record with that vote. >> sean: how about voting to delay the funding. >> just keep putting it up for vote. >> sean: then, obama says republicans are shutting down the government. >> probably it won't pass in the senate. we've got a lot of democrats up for election next year. get them on the record. you don't -- . >> sean: call it a delay? >> try it. demand votes on it. keep voting. >> sean: what happens we get to the point the house defunds it, send to it senate. the senate won't go alongwitness or they do. >> yes. but have the vote. >> sean: then what do you from there is in the president saying i'm not going along with this. >> see what the landscape is. where the teamster is going to be. >> sean: great question. did you think you'd be in agreement with jimmy hoffa? >> don't like obama care, it's different to shut down, sorry the third guy says things are different. in 1994 that was before the internet was big. before fox news, 1995 when this happened. it's a different media landscape. there are different people pushing this and it's over a different issue and an issue, obama care hated by a vast majority. sleazy methods used to pass this and just dropped in our laps the irs and who isrunning obama care? irs. >> reagan asked a question sit a third part yes we need or revitalized second party. >> do not talk about third parties. >> sean: okay. i'm talking about revitalized second party. wait a minute. he got on their air and said you do these love stories to hillary you're not going to get debates, everybody i know is like go fight. they want a fight. >> a fight should be over amnesty. it ruins everything. hispanics support obama care, they support gay marriage they support abortion. they support big government. look at the polls. everything with and we lose the country. we have no say over who an american sitd sen is?democrats can't win with american that's is why they need to bring in a new electorate. it's being slipped through and yes, we should revitalize the republican party. throw out republican who's support amnesty. >> sean: is the love affair with chris christie over? >> sadly, over amnesty. that is when it ended with george bush, too. not only for me but a lot of conservatives.

i think not. here with reaction from the center of law and justice and steve murphy. before we get to the new information can we just get out of the way targeting american citizens or groups because oftheir political views is not a phony scandal? could we just get that on the table from you? >> well, if that's what happened, sure. if the fec knows about tax exempt money being used on behalf of partisan candidates, they should tell the irs that because it's not legal. >> is that why lois lerner pleaded the fifth? >> there's only one problem with that. that's against the law. >> steve, let him talk. >> go ahead. >> it's not a citizen. it's two governmental agencies. there's specific provisions that prohibit it with groups like the fec. the fec is not exempt. it's not one of them. that's number one. >> so you're defending usingtamt exempt dollars. >> you keep cutting me off, but let me give you facts. eric holder said there may be criminal investigations. sean, i'm representing one of the groups. they say they need an exception of time, why, because of criminal investigations of irs officials. that's pretty clear although we haven't been contacted by anybody with the fbi but they're saying there's an investigation. number three, the lois lerner e-mail back and forth to the fec lawyer was going on when there was not even an fec investigation. that has to be authorized. you know what the answer is? no wonder she took the fifth amendment. >> before we get to that, jay, i want to ask you one more question. explain, though, the law as it relates to the collusion between the fec and the irs. explain it. >> there are particular provisions of the internal revenue code. remember, sean, i came out of the irs chief counsel's officewhen i came out of law school. a government agency like the irs cannot share taxpayer information including ongoing investigations, audit information, with the fec as an entity. that's not legal. number two, by the way, to steves point, they cannot share taxpayer information that it has with a private citizen either. those are criminal acts by government fisofficials do them. they weren't even involved in an investigation but in no case can they share that information, period. there's no exception. >> all right, steve? >> you're making a point that the irs can't share information with the fec and issa is accusing the fec of having it go the other way around. there tees nothing wrong with the -- >> the i'm came from the fec. >> you're arguing in favor of a gigantic loophole for tax exempt money to be used for political campaigns. >> no, i'm not.>> yes, you are. that's what you're defending. >> i'm defending the law. millions of dollars. >> you know what, steve? it was president obama who came out and said -- you know, steve, president obama came out and said this is outrageous, this is wrong, people will be held accountable. >> steve, steve, steve -- guys, hang on a second, guys, wait a minute. >> they are wrong. >> steve, let him finish his thought and then you get to speak. back to jay. jay, finish your thought. come on. >> go ahead, jay. >> okay. so it's very clear. the irs despite steve's protests to dontrary cannot legally share information with the fec. >> agreed. it's the fec -- >> steve, let him talk. that's different -- >> no, the irs -- lois -- did you read the e-mails? lois lerner responded as to the tax status of the group fec was engaging in. she responded. that's why she took the fifthamendment. do you think she took the fifth amendment because she felt like it or maybe her lawyers evaluated the situation and said, you know what, lois, you'd better take the fif aboutt fift incriminate yourself. >> just be happy that you have the loophole -- >> you know what? organizations on the left have been -- >> you want it both ways. you want it both ways. and the irs should examine -- >> i want the law applied. >> they should examine whether it's legitimately charitable expenditures or wherever it's for partisan -- >> that's not the questions they asked. you know, that's not the questions the internal revenue service asked. 's the problem here. they didn't ask what your activity was. >> that's what congressman issa is investigating. >> and what their positions were on particular issues. >> all right, guys. we've got to to leave it there. >> read the law, steve. i suggest you start reeting the internal revenue code i don't want to be a lawyer.i'll leave it to you. you're a good one. >> you might learn something. thank you both for being with us.   coming up, in a move that looks similar to social engineering, president obama wants to plan diversity over government zip codes. and then tonight -- >> trayvon martin paralleled to tim ma mill. same thing. >> that's why president obama is our president. he knows not to get himself in a movie and be on fox news every day. >> a huge firestorm just days after oprah made those controversial comments. she has been named a recipient of the nation's highest civilian honor. plus, still time to cast your video of the day. you get to vote. it comes to us courtesy of the boston transit cop who's been replaced by a cardboard cutout to fend off criminals and it's actually working. if you want to hear what the [ male announcer ] come to the golden opportunity sales eventand experience the connectivity of the available lexus enform, including the es and rx. ♪ this is the pursuit of perfection.car insurance companies say they'll save you by switching, you'd have like, a ton of dollars. but how're they saving you those dollars?

what's the plan here? what do they say? >> the bottom line is hud has been doing this for decades. this is about politics. black leaders have been courageous enough to go against this president. you've had the former chair of the black caucus say if obama was a white president we'd march on the white house. the fact is we're losing our homes. >> your reaction, santita? >> we have to rise above politicbecause the fact is no one expects -- everyone to achieve the same level of success. it's not what giejs to happen. what everyone does deserve is equal access to the american dream. right now we don't have it. just because you're not going to live in mansion doesn't mean you should be stuck in the mud. that's wrong. fdr had it right. you should have freedom of want. they don't need to be told there niece no room at the inn. >> i'm so glaed you mentioned freedom because a part of our nation is about freedom. there's freedom to work where we want to and live where we want to and to have the federal government say, okay, we're going to diversify your neighborhoods? the only thing i think is good, the liberal limousines, i wonder what they're saying now that they gave obama donations. >> i live in thoseneighborhoods. live on the south side of chicago. those directly impact me. what i want to see as i said before, all americans have equal access to the american dream. the fact is we don't. you have 18 million units, vacant units of housing in the united states of america, 3.5 million people who are homeless. >> if we don't have the jobs, can we afford the mortgages? >> no, we cannot. you know what else -- >> let me jump in here for a second. i want to explain this a little bit better to our audience. santita, if somebody works hard, they want to move into a particular community and there was any effort to discriminate against them, that's a legitimate claim. >> absolutely. >> that would be discrimination perhaps based on race or color, ethnicity, whatever it happens to be. >> or sexual orientation. >> but that's very different. seem like they're trying to engineer this somehow through government interventions andprograms. that's the antithesis of freedom because then the government is orchestrating that. >> you know, absolutely. and i don't believe in government interference but i certainly do believe in government intervention. little rock 9 had that when they desegregated the schools back in arkansas. they intervened. when they went into the public schools, when the kids started attacking some of the students the national guard said hands off. >> is this the same thing, santita? >> let me say this, angela. when you have african-americans make 1g $00,000 a year or more, you know what happened to them? they were scared into subprime loans. that's not right. can we agree on that? >> the bottom line is we have court systems where you can sue but this is just a gesture to satisfy a certain segment of society that has supported obama and the bottom line is he's in the second term, now he can do whatever he wants do and in the black community his approval rating has gone down ten points. >> mm-hmm.>> so he needs something to -- >> that's right. but you need -- >> i've got a question for -- wait a second. >> okay. excuse me. >> are black americans better off now that obama is in his fifth year as president?

how do you make that comparisonbecause i've never seen -- i like oprah. i think she's extraordinary fairly gifted. i've never seen her as racial in any way. >> son, let me get this -- >> let me get this out of the way since this your night of having black women telling that they love you. i love you, sean. >> i love you, hannity. >> we are better than this. the second part of her statement she effusively praised the united states and how far we've come and we shouldn't get mired in this. >> she made a comparison. >> a few of her words. you shouldn't be parsing a few of her words. that's what another network does. the thing is oprah said very clearly the facts weren't the same but the way they resonated within the civil rights community, the way they resonated in america around civil rights issues, that's what she was comparing so let's not parse words and call oprahwinfrey a race bagger?

plus the suicide of an internet activist finds his family crying foul. was aaron schwartz a victim of government intimidation and a run away prosecutor. >> while there's no law or set of laws that can prevent everysinceless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent he every tragedy, every act of evil, if there's even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try it. >> paul: welcome to the journal editorial report, i'm paul gigot, that was president obama rolling out the plan to curb gun violence and the president outlined 23 executive actions, including more steps to make more federal data available from background checks and increased access to mental health services and he called on congress to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban and prohibit high capacity gun magazines that can hold more than ten rounds. so, what's likely to get passed and what difference will it make? let's ask wall street journal columnist and political heeditor and washington columnist kim strassel. >> has a hypothetical, let's assume that everything the president is proposing becomes law. what difference would it make? >> well, it's not quite a hypothetical, paul. the president just said, if we can save just one life, if we have to do this, from 1994, to 2004, we had the law banning assault rifles and high capacity magazines. the national research council and the centers for disease control took a deep look at the effect of that law and their conclusion was, it was impossible to determine whether it had reduced any crime in the united states, in 2005, the national research council looked again. their conclusion was that the government's collection of data about guns is so poor, that it's impossible to understand whether any good is coming of these laws. you'd hate to reduce it to something as bureaucratic as the federal government's inability to track these guns, but that is about what it comes down to.there is just no evidence that those laws make any difference. >> in fact, paul, gun violence has fallen since the assault weapons ban expired. >> paul: in 2004. >> in 2004. the relevant question is that these are proposals being put forward in response to sandy hook and gun violence overall in the country. so, will they address that problem? the university background check would have been passed by the person who bought the gun used in connecticut. >> paul: well, let me argue that some the things he's proposed on mental health, easing the laws hipaa, a federal privacy law, and like administrators in schools or doctors and medical officers be able to share information when they see some kid who seems to be troubled, and identify him and maybe push him in assisted treatment, that kind of thing would help, seems to me. >> it would definitely help. that side of it is the piece we haven't had much of a conversation about. >> almost like an afterthought that the president offered it,but may be the most effective. >> newtown event, virginia tech, killing in the theaters in colorado by these violently mentally ill people, really is not related to gun control, it's about what you're describing, which is monitoring and ensuring that those people are taking their medication and that's what's been a weak part of the system until perhaps now. >> also keep in mindless than 3% of gun crimes in this country involve the assault weapons that the president wants to ban. >> paul: most of them are handguns actually. why isn't he proposing then to ban handguns? >> well, why not? >> if most people who are victims of gun violence are killed by handguns, why not ban handguns. >> the handguns are illegal on the streets of chicago and new york, and gang crimes. >> it's also unconstitutional, a second amendment. >> and that was found in 2008, the heller case which expressly involved handguns and guns in common use.>> individual rights. >> and assault weapons are also in many places in common use. these so-called-- i mean, there are two million of them in circulation, and so, this may not actually stand up to court scrutiny, if it passed. >> right, everything, actually about this particular gun debate, the first one we're having an a decade, has to be seen in the light that heller is now the law of the land in the supreme court. and what the gun control community calls assault weapons are used as most people are semi automatics and particular ones that they ban happen to look more scary than other semi automatics, as you said there are millions in circulation and the burden upon the gun control crowd would be to explain why some of them should be okay to be out there and others not. that's a hard case to make in light of heller. >> paul: kim, let's move on to the politics, you've been skeptical anything like the assault weapons ban will pass. >> you've got to look at democrats in particular. >> paul: senate democrats. >> no, this is aboutdemocrats, okay? in red states, in swing states, their communities are very pro second amendment and this is playing with fire in their reelection prospects if they want to go out and touch on gun control again. this is why even harry reid has not said he's going to embrace any of the measures that the president put forward and when you add to that the fact you have a republican house and no appetite to deal with this, this would be difficult to get through congress. >> i believe there's a racial element to the debate. >> how so? >> the president and left is not eager to discuss, and that is the fact the large proportion of gun violence is taking place in our inner cities and it's black on black violence, is what we're seeing, and if you are black, your chances of being involved in gun violence, either as a perpetrator or a victim are several times higher than they are if you are white and that's a discussion that this president is uniquely qualified to have and doesn't want to have and neither does the left who complains we wantto have discussions about racism. >> paul: and one point, michael bloomberg, independently wealthy, planning and shown in the past election and maybe more so this time, to put tens of millions of dollars on behalf of gun control against candidates, couldn't this challenge the national rifle association, its influence?

so, do you recognize yourself, jason, in that? >> the public says that the-- their expectations for the next four years are much lower than they were the first time. which i guess is understandable given the second term presidents, that usually happens. what your expectations for a second term. >> socialized medicine is expensive so expect obama to aggressively try and fund his first term agenda in the second term and that means, raising more revenue, more tax hikes. i think that people who make around $100,000 are really rich. you've got to go where the money is and looking for him to hit the middle class with more tax hikes in the second term. i think a top priority. >> paul: he's got to find the money somewhere to get to do this. dan, what about the theory or what you're hearing from liberals and cheering it, no more mr. nice guy. the president is going to take on republicans, way too compromising in the the firstterm, not that i recognize that president, but that's the line that they're taking and so, look,er erhe's going to put them in their place and demonize them and sigma advertise them. >> we are going to see-- they're looking for a look on the radio, the president of the united states like a left wing talk show host. we're in the midst of a revolution and it's a take no prisoners revolution. when he talks about the elderly talking about obamacare and medicare, and talk about not caring whether important enough to eat, that's food stamps, as jason sucked he suggested he's looking for a way to transfer the wealth, not from just from the wealthy, but down to-- >> he's popular, personal approval rating close to 60-- >> the fly in the ointment is the unemployment rate andgrowth rate. he's got four years and if the unemployment gets worth again, there's no growth incentives in the obama agenda, it's going to start eroding the popularity and leaning on him as he tries to achieve the social revolution. >> paul: from the journal, the political analyst, wrote this week that the president is likely to be more aggressive and he predicted it, because there's assumption in the white house that they now have essentially a real liberal majority in the country, that his coalition that showed up on election day is such that they don't need to the way that bill clinton did losing conservative voters, particularly swing voters anymore, because they have a new coalition and that's driving the president to say, look, we can satisfy these long-term pentup liberal demands and you see that as true? >> i would argue that that analysis is probably the best way of looking at this president and understanding what he's doing. democratic presidents in the past, you've looked at billclinton, they understood and they believed there was a real benefit to being somewhat in the middle, centrist and working with republicans and getting things done and getting that vast bipartisan approval quotient. and this president hasn't done that, but he believes he has what it takes to have the democrats in office with a liberal majority and that brings up a huge question how sincere he is over the next two years about some of the item agenda, agenda items he's put forward like immigration, or whether this is about taking issues making republicans look like they're disunited and unable to govern and route them out of the house in 2014 and have everyone unified on the last two years. >> and one on the left might be some democrats and somerepublican-leaning seats in the senate, states that need to win their senate seats in order for the democrats to continue holding majority in the senate we're talking about arkansas, alaska, north carolina and so forth. and if obama wants to pursue an aggressive agenda in the second term, he can't afford to lose the senate and not have either the senate or the house. >> you know, dan, i agree with you about the one essential here, that is economic growth. the president can't come close to finding his ambitions with 2% growth and he can't come close to raising middle class incomes which have been falling since the economic recovery started, without getting growth to 3, 4%. that will see, that seems to me to be what will determine whether or not his second term is ultimately a success. >> and facts historically low in the first term if he doesn't get it up it's not going to happen, paul. >> i agree with you, dan. >> when we come back a 26-year-old computer hacker commits suicide after a federal indictment that could have put him behind bars fordecades. supporters say that aaron schwartz w w w w w ♪ so, i'm working on a cistern intake valve, and the guy hands me a locknut wrench. no way! i'm like, what is this, a drainpipe slipknot?
